Hey. I'm Dom. But you probably guessed that from the URL.
By day I work for a small company supporting other companies and schools that use Macs. I install servers and desktops running Mac OS X, help solve problems and resolve issues, and generally deal with the business bits of being a small company. In the evening I swap between bassist for [Corsairs](http://www.myspace.com/corsairstheband), husband, and amateur photographer.  

In 2004 I got my first Mac, a 15" G4 Powerbook, and I loved it. I gave up on using the Dell desktop I had been using previously (which my parents still use to this day) and got deeply submerged in the Apple world. Since then I've had a MacBook Pro, and now a MacBook Air, an iPhone, iPhone 3GS, multiple iPods, and all manner of accessories.

I write here about a lot of stuff, technology, money, life, the usual stuff. I also tweet, tumble, and a bunch of other stuff so check out the links on the right.
