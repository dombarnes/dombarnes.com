I joined Three in Feb 2006. Big mistake. I signed up for a 18 month contract. First I changed my mind about the handset, from the N71 to 6280. I also called 3 to change to a 12 month contract, which they "did" and confirmed over the phone.
A short while later, my phone started playing up. It was restarting, not receiving text messages, giving me false voicemail alerts. Useless. I sent it back, it came back, I loaded my contacts, calendar, messages back on, redownloaded the apps, and carried on.




Shortly after, same thing again. Sent it back, came back, new firmware, loaded my contacts, calendar, messages, apps, carried on.




New problem. Message centre deleted. Checked on the website, found this was a common problem with my phone, and reinput the message centre details, could text again.




Shortly after, still same problem as before. Called 3. Explained problem to foreign sounding customer service representative. Asked if i had the message centre input, I said I did, but didn't before, (was talking about the text message problem). I said it was fine, and I had checked all that, he told me to go to Nokia service to get a fix. I got put through to a Nokia recorded message, which told me how to reinput my message centre. I didn't need to know this. Waited for a Nokia technician, explained the problem again, and was told to go back to 3 as it was their problem. Called back 3. Explained problem as well as being put through to a number that would help me with a problem I already explained I didn't have. Finally got it arranged to have my phone sent back, got the envelope, sent it back through the Post Office. Phone came back, newer firmware, reinstalled contacts, calendars, messages, apps, lost access to Eddie Izzard videos I had downloaded from 3.




Its all runing fine now, and as I was coming up to 12 months, I contacted 3 to cancel my contract. Wrote them a nice letter, asked for PAC code, sent it off. Called up to check it was being dealt with. They told me, much to my surprise, I was on a 18 month contract. I explained they were wrong, it was 12 months, they looked at their records which said I was told I had to go to Phones4U and change it there. No I wasn't. I sighed, explained the problem, how I'd had loads of handset problems, got no compassion, just "18 month contract" and "expires in August".




I went searching the net for ideas. Got one. Ask for a copy of the contract. They often won't take copies, so if they can't prove your contract, you should be ok. So I've asked for that. If that comes back and they have a copy, then I have a backup plan. I will call 3, and ask them to replay me the telephone call. I know what they told me, they have their records, if they can prove that I was told to go to Phones4U then fine, if not, then I want my contract cancelled. I'm gonna give them till tomorrow to respond, then I'll call them on saturday. I don't wanna wait for another 6 months. I want to change my phone now, get away from 3 and to a nice network, like Orange or T-Mobile.




Some complaints about 3:






  1. Initially, they restricted internet access on the phone to sites 3 had "approved". Useless


  2. I can't use my phone to get online with my laptop. I wanna use bluetooth and take advantage of the 3G download speeds on my laptop. Doesn't work. Its blocked unless you pay a hell of a lot of money.


  3. I can't call and speak to someone who understands my problem, and I can communicate with. I'm not racist, its just frustrating trying to sort a problem with my phone when I have to repeat myself, or go through a series of questions to establish my problem


  4. They spend ages answering calls. Same can be said of a lot of places though


  5. They deleted off some 3D games from the handset before distributing it (3d snake, 3d rally)


  6. They put me through to a Nokia helpline for a problem I had already told them I didn't have.




So I'm annoyed with Three, to say the least. I advise anyone out there not to use them. Orange, T-Mobile, Vodafone, all have great plans. There is no reason to use Three. I won't, and a I won't recommend them ever.
