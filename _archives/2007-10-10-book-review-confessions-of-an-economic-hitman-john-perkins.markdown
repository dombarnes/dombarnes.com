I first heard of [Confessions of an Economic Hitman](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Confessions-Economic-Hit-Man-Shocking/dp/0091909104/ref=pd_bbs_1/202-9935036-3680638?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192038631&sr=8-1) from [John C Dvorak](http://dvorak.org/blog) on [TWiT](http://twit/tv) one week during the [Audible](http://www.audible.com/twit) Book Recommendation. In preparation of my holiday in sunny...nay rainy week in Scotland and I decided to pick up this to read while away.
The basic premise of this book is the true life story of John Perkins, who was recruited by MAIN, after dropping out of college and being asked to take a NSA analysis for a possible job there. His job was an an economist for MAIN, travelling to various countries around the world. His role was to provide evidence that if they borrowed billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) their economy would grow. In reality, they were being manipulated into taking these big loans, then using the money to employ large American Multinational Corporations (the "corporatocracy") to build and develop the economy. In truth, as well as plunging them into huge debt, it also puts them at the will of the USA, often to allow them to take advantage of the county.




Its a really interesting story of the authors journey through life, coming to realise his true place in the world, and the results of his actions, and then his subsequent to redemption.




This book will really change the way you view the US government, and their actions over the timeframe of this book. It explains the reasons behind Iraq and many other big events in the US history.




If you believe in the conspiracy of the US, or want to learn about this possible view of the events othe last 35 years, then get this book. Its a really interesting read and I think you'll love it, just like I did.
