I've entered the world of GPS a.k.a. sat nav. I recently got a HP iPaq 5450 PDA (partly [GTD](http://www.davidco.com) reasons), a 2GB SD memory card and a Holux GPSlim 240 Bluetooth GPS receiver. And with the magic of some navigation software, I now have the ability to get from A to B with little or no stress. Great. All I really need is a reason to use it, apart from to drive back to my parents for christmas (and I already know the way having driven it countless times).
Ever wonder why you bought something? I often find myself getting really into something (like getting a PDA) from a blog post, or website, and then spending loads to occomplish my task, which may not actually have a purpose. Hopefully when I change jobs (sooner rather than later) I will have a decent reason to use one. Until then, guide me home oh sat nav lady!
