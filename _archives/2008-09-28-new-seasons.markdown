Boy do I watch a lot of TV. Yet surprisingly not much is actually on the TV. I'm a big fan of lots of the American dramas, and have watched Dawson's Creek, The OC, Gilmore Girls, and others come and go. But I always like this time of year, because all the new seasons start. So, for the next 8 months (roughly) I will be watching:
One Tree Hill (recent convert), Smallville, Heroes,  Big Bang Theory, Numb3rs, Chuck, and beginning in Janurary, Lost.




However I really just wanted to share this great advert which appeals to two of my interests. Can you guess which?

And here is the second one. (and yes I know the ads aren't current but hey, who cares)
