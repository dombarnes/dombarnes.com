Don't worry. This isn't a tribute to our favorite(!) Durst-assisted band, Stain'd (why the apostrophe? is an e that difficult to find in the keyboard?) Its just an explaination of where I've been. Here's a run down.
1. Been moving house. This means packing boxes, buying furniture, moving boxes, putting together ikea flat packs, contacting many companies about my new address, emptying boxes, cleaning the new place, cleaning the old place, buying food, and some other bits and pieces.
2. Trying to get someone to look at our (new) broken fridge that is about 10 degrees too warm (15C at the mo)
3. Trying to do some studying for my A+
4. Working - gotta make a living
5. Actually sitting down once in a while.




I'm gonna try and do part 3 of the Great Mac Apps. Hopefully the list and indepth reports are useful. Its always worth hearing a bit about apps, rather than a list. On that note, check out [osx.iusethis.com](http://osx.iusethis.com)Â for more great app ideas and some reviews too.
Have a look at my shared Google reader feed. I throw a lot of Mac stuff in there, including some great articles on Quicksilver. It is the best app I can't live without (apart from iTunes).




Please leave comments on the blog. If you find something useful, let me know, let me know what else you wanna know about. I might be able to help, after all I wanna get a job working with Mac's in the future.




Should also be some band news soon, once we have a practice (last one was a few weeks back and was dreadful. seriously bad). Check us out at [www.virb.com/douglasfurs](http://www.virb.com/douglasfurs) and add us as friends. More tracks will appear as soon as we can record some.
