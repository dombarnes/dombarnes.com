Date: 13 December 2006Venue: Rich Bitch, Selly Oak




Midweek practice this week since the weekend has posed some problems, one of which being Fake-Christmas. So we went for a afterwork session. Not so easy when your work is so fussy about leaving 15 minutes earlier that I had to take a shorter lunch. Not that anyone actually checked up on me. So I got there about 20 mins late, which wasn't too bad but I worry.




Played the usual Russia and then moved on to working on the new song, the two chord special created out of fear of being too complex. James has some lyrics and a name Sequoia (might need to check spelling). Not sure what its about since I don't get a chance to listen to the lyrics but its coming together well. Had a brief debate over whether to go Intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, outro; or Intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, outro. I think we're going the for the second one. But either way, we finally have two songs to call our own! Thats halfway to an EP, almost a repertoire.




Next session to be next thursday before a break for Christmas or whatever holiday you may choose to celebrate.
