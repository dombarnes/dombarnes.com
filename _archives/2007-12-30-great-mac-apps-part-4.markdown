Ok, well I failed and didn't do this over Christmas. Had too much to do giving advice to my parents about their own PC's to worry about mine. But here it is, the fourth and final part of my Great Mac Apps segment.
![](http://www.eternalstorms.at/gimmesometune/files/page1_1.png)GimmeSomeTune - This is the most useful iTunes plugin I use (and the only but thats beside the point). What it does is simple. It does loads. I will give you on-screen displays (like Growl) of your currently playing tracks, add hotkeys to control iTunes globally. It will fetch album art from Amazon, it will even fetch song lyrics from Leo's Lyrics (which I find particularly useful). Basically, its a nice little plugin to have running. Only downside is upgrading it isn't the easiest thing to do.




[Missing Sync for Windows](http://www.markspace.com/) - I won't say much about this since I don't use it now. I was using it to sync my iPaq 5450 PDA with Address Book, and iCal. Its still really useful, but since I got my iPhone, I don't use it. Still worth checking out if you own a PDA.




[Miro](http://www.getmiro.com) (Formerly Democracy) -Its like TV on your computer, from the internet, like IPTV almost. Its a massively useful program that will let you watch video and audio from the web. There is a built in directory for videos, and you can subscribe to podcast feeds and (here is the best bit) you can subscribe to bit torrent RSS feeds and get your fave shows as soon as they are released. I tend to use it for any shows I don't wanna watch on my iPhone, like Command-N, Webnation, Unwired, Diggnation (sometimes) and so on. Check. It. Out.

[Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/office2004/office2004.aspx?pid=office2004) - Now we all love our Macs, how could we not, but the fact is, there is a large amount of people who don't know about them, so use Windows, and they are likely to have Office (99% for Word) so to help them in their niche little world, we can get Microsoft Office for Mac. And guess what? It's actually better than the Windows version. I could tell you why, but why don't you just try out the [30-day trial](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/default.aspx?pid=office2004td) and see for yourself.
If you're not bothered about the tracking features, and other advanced stuff, try [iWork '08](http://www.apple.com/iwork/) from Apple. Its lurvly.




[Onxy](http://www.titanium.free.fr/index_us.html) - Another little utility which you can use to keep your Mac running smoothly. Great for laptop users. The most useful tools are clearing caches (to free up some much needed free space) and running the cron jobs that should run to help maintain your disk which usually run at 3am.

Well thats your lot. I'm done with this. I might put up some more suggestions as I think of them, but for now, I can close this chapter of my blog.
