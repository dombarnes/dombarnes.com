Well its my birthday next week. Grand old age of 24. Not really an anything age. Of course people are asking me about presents. And I don't know what to say. At this very point in time, I can't think of anything I want. The only thing I want is an iPhone and thats being paid for by my bonus this month, and its not even out for about 7 weeks.
But nothing comes to mind. No CD's, DVD's, things for the house, books, electrical goods, clothes, nothing. And that just leaves me feeling empty strangely. You would thing that the person who wants nothing has everything they could ask for and must be happy. But I'm not. I'm unhappy. Not always. And not in a constant depressive state, but in bouts of unhappiness. I was feeling like this yesterday. I think what is missing? Well a few things. Good friends for starters. I don't really have anyone who I speak to loads, or hang out with lots. No best friend. Really its just the band who are my friends. And thats depressing to me. I have had a few rough times with friends in the past (accused of racism by my best friend, later, found out that my group of friends all thought i was a scheming manipulative person who cared about no one else, and then abandoned after I went out with my friends ex even though he was a complete b**stard to her and completely warranted being dumped but of course its not how well you know someone or how much you trust them, but the how LONG you know them that matters, and as the most recent friend, I get cut out easily. Well I hope you're all miserable living at home with your parents still, doing the same thing you used to, not growing up and getting on with life) RANT! Wow.




So then i think "well I have no hobby that can be a present source" and I think what do I have in my life? I have the band, which I love being in, and the rest of my time is spent doing house stuff, or on my laptop.
I wanna expand my horizons. Next month I'm going to the Midlands Mac User Group in Birmingham. Hoping I'll meet some interesting people who I get on well with and can geek out around. And maybe make a friend.




So really I'm just feeling sad with life. I'm not really enjoying work, can't leave because its worth my time to stick around till next year, am running low on cash after moving and a holiday (£600 into overdraft!).




And next week its my birthday. And all I want to do is let is blow by.  I'm gonna go out for a meal with Katie and thats it. Not taking the day off cos whats the point. Nothing I want to look forward to. So bring on 24. Show me what you can do!
