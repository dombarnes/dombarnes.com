So I've had my second band practice and I'm starting to think about gear. I have my bass guitar (a Westfield - don't ask me what) and I have a Boss Zoom multi-effects pedal with tuner, separate tuner and I'm thinking about buying some individual pedals to add to the mix. But I'm not sure what. Do I get a distortion, overdrive, or chorus pedal? We're playing rockier music so no need for any bluesy sounds.
I am looking at a Boss ODB-3 Overdrive pedal. It seems pretty good. Haven't actually tried one but if I get a few cheap ones I can see what I prefer and look for a more quality pedal next time. And then I'll always have a spare.




Also wondering about earphones. I like the Etymotic 6i Isolator earphones. They're just a bit expensive. But ideal for monitors, and i can use them when recording tracks into Garageband.




Of course, last on my list is a new guitar. I've had the westfield for over 4 years and feel like a new one. But I have yet to see one i like. When I do, its going straight on the credit card, or present list.
