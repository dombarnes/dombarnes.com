I arrived at 10.15, had a drink from Starbucks and went to wait. It wasn't until about 12pm that the first people started the queue, and then I made my move. I'm now sitting here, in 4th place on a cold hard floor waiting for my iPhone.There's 7 people so far (12.44pm) and its bound to grow.Check out Flickr for photos during the day!
