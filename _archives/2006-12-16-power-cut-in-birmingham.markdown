So I woke up this morning at about 6.40. However I didn't know it was then because my clock wasn't working which was strange. So I sat up, tried my lamp which didn't work either. My girlfriend went to turn the bathroom light on and it didn't work. So I checked the fuse box and it was all on. So I soon realised there must've been a powercut. It was pretty dark outside, and hard to tell if any lights were off since I don't really look outside at night.  
I stuck some clothes on and went down towards the front desk. Luckily, I ran into a woman only 2 floors down who told me the news. There had been a fire at a power station and had cut power to the entire city. It was possibly going to be out until the afternoon. I walked back to my apartment and got out a radio to see if there was anything being said about it when the power came back on (and with it running water).  

The strangest thing is its now been about an hour since it came back on, and about 4 since it went off and I can't seem to find any mention of it on the news or the internet. Why hasn't this been reported? Surely someone has realised and thought it worthy of mentioning. I mean the power goes out to the second largest city in the UK and not even a whisper?  

Well I claim to be the first (as far as I know) to report this. Its 8.13am. Power is back (obviously since I can get online) and the city is coming back into action.
