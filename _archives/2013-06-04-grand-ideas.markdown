We all have them. Big plans. Great ideas. If only we had the money and time.   

My ideas are pretty simple ones.   

1. Open a burrito bar in Birmingham. Yes, it would also do tacos, quesadillas, and other such Mexican food.   

2. Open a bar. [Who doesn't want to](http://youtu.be/8dsjWRinnVs)?   

3. Open a co-working space in Birmingham. Listening to [In Beta #50](http://5by5.tv/inbeta/50) and listening to Kevin talk about CoWork Buffalo made my think about this again.   

4. Learn Xcode and write my own iPhone/iPad app and make a fortune. Not [King Marco](http://www.marco.org) fortune, but would be nice to clear some debt.  





The only thing stopping me is determination, finding the time to start on these projects, and, probably a little knowledge and funding. So nothing major.
