I was just watching some TV and a PC World advert came on, advertising the latest cheap laptop.
Two things made me think. First, the man in the ad (selling to a woman...who obviously knows nothing about computers, I'm surprised she wasn't scared to leave the kitchen(!) (please, lets break some stereotypes please?)) and stated how she didn't have to buy anti-virus software because it was "pre-installed". As a Mac user, I would say "oh no, you don't need anti-virus. Its a Mac!"
Ok, this could start a whole debate on virus' on mac. Yes I know its not impossible, but I do believe its harder to cause more damage thanks to the Unix/BSD backbone.




The second thing was, the salesman exclaimed at the Intel Core 2 Duo chip that let the user "run more than one application at once, so you can listen to music while surfing the internet"!!!!! WOW!!!! Thats completely amazing. Surely thats never been possible. Has it? Oh wait, thats why people spent years working on memory management in the kernel so that we can do this (names escape me but I'm looking at you, Macintosh developers).




What did I do to make a point? I opened every application I have in my dock. Thats 18 applications plus System Preferences. How well did my laptop run? Fine. So much so that I could even hit Expose and display all my open windows at once. And here's how it looked.

Even more fun was running this in slow motion by holding Shift.  I also noticed a neat feature, that Photobooth continues to update the camera view even in Expose!




Wow. Multiprocessors eh!  Wow.
