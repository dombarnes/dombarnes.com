Don't use tiscali. Seriously. Don't. I do and I wish I didn't. I got an email back on 29 July 2006 saying that my internet usage was excessive and that was my first warning. I got my second and final on 9 November 2006. On 8 December I got capped. My internet usage between 6pm and 11pm (when I'm at home. Useful)So it got to 8 February 2007 and I was getting frustrated with my slow speeds. I did some speedtests and was getting 1.31Mbps, 1.55,1.59Mbps download, when I am paying for an 8Mb connection.
I called Tiscali support, and after first being cut off as I was about to speak to a human, I explained the problem and was told to keep my usage down for a week, and it would return to normal. Regardless, I emailed my problem to the address they told me to. I got my email bounced back. I went looking on the website for some help and found a form to complete, so I did and waited for a reply. On 15 Feb I emailed back as I had got no reply. Their auto-response said 3 days to reply. It had been 5. I emailed again on 16 Feb, 18 Feb, 19 Feb. On 22 Feb I got a reply from the online form. They said email broadbandservices@uk.tiscali.com and put "FUP Warning 1/2" in the subject. So I did. And I waited. On 26 Feb I emailed back and waited. I resent it again on 1 March. On 2 March I emailed again, made a fuss about having to wait so long to get a reply. On 11 March I got this reply:
Thank you for contacting Tiscali Customer Support.

I've** ALREADY** done this!
So I replied to say I had done so and got no response. (wafs!)
So today I've emailed again. For the _13th_ time now. I still have had no formal response, and am still getting shit download speeds.
So for the love of god, don't use Tiscali. Their customer service is appauling. You will find it difficult to get a decent answer on the phone, or by email.
I'm now moving and am gonna switch to cable and let's hope our internet speeds will get back to normal.
