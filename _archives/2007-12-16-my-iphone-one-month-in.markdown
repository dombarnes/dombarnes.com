Its th 16th of December and I've had my iPhone for a month. So what are my thoughts so far?
Well overall I'm really pleased. I can easily say the main features I've used are Mail and Safari . Since Gmail opened up IMAP, I've got my gmail accounts set up in Mail.app so I get all my mail straight to my hand, so I can keep on top of the Google Groups, blog comments, and various other emails I get.




I really love the Maps. While I had Google Maps on my last phone, its nothing compared to the experience on an iPhone. The scrolling is fantastic, and even though its on EDGE, loading of the maps seems so much faster. Its also really easy to look up people in my contacts list, or look for business (which came in handy recently) as they appear in the search box as you type. The routing is great, and really well animated which makes it so much nicer to use.




The SMS conversations are great. I would like to be able to forward texts, send multi-recipient messages. I'd also like to be able to clear conversations up to a point (to save a specific message), but besides that, its a hell of a lot nicer dealing with texts in a chat form, rather than an email format.




There isn't much else I can say that hasn't been said a hundred times on a hundred blogs. I look forward to the future software updates and am excited to see what Apple offer for new features.




For what its worth, my thoughts on Macworld are this: No iPhone 2.0, no 3G iPhone announcement, more likely details of the SDK, software examples, the coveted ultra-thin Macbook or Tablet, maybe a power boost on the rest of the line.
One thing I'd like to see is a bump on the Airport Express, and see it taken up to 802.11n, although I have just bought one of eBay so that would upset me a bit.




Well we'll be discussing the topics of the keynote at [MMUG](http://www.mmug.org.uk/node/26) that night so if you're in the area, come along.
