That title may not make much sense, and thats cos its a really far off simily (look it up) to my current work situation.




As I said before, I'm currently impending redundancy, and this week, we reached the end of the consultancy period. What does that mean? Well they are now at free liberty to give us our 30 days notice at any point. There has to be some formal dismissal hearing, and then 48 hours, but basically we'll be going soon.




What does that mean for me? Well of course I'm looking for a new job. I wanna take this as an opportunity to get out of my industry and into IT. So I'm spending my time looking at IT Technician, Help desk jobs, anything that I can get for a good starting job, where I can do hardware and software repairs, and if possible, some travel.




I think I wanna get into network admin. At least that's what I feel like I wanna do so I'll follow that path unless my heart says otherwise.




So if you're interested in hiring an aspiring IT Technician, who is A+ certified and working on his Network+, then please drop me a note and make me an offer.




Otherwise, I'll keep trawling those online job search sites, and watching the hours tick away at work, as the share price drops, as well as my level of concentration and focus. ![](/assets/shareprice.png)




Until then, I'll be working more on the new site, perfecting the theme for launch. Which hopefully won't be too many more weeks away.




And speaking of that, is there anyway of getting my posts on the old blog to auto-forward to the new blog? Maybe not but worth asking. I'd just like to drive traffic away from the old, and make sure I'm still getting visitors to the new one for the same searches. Leave me a note in the comments.
