Two things I wanna know.1. Why doesn't the ring volume match the SMS volume? My Glass SMS tone is SOO much louder than my ring tone (Marimba) when its on the quietest setting.
2. Why isn't there an easier 1.1.2 hack rather than downgrading? I just want iPushr or something to send to flickr, rather than email.




Wish I knew more people with iPhones. I've only seen one out on the streets, and only one other person at [MMUG](http://www.mmug.org.uk) has one.
