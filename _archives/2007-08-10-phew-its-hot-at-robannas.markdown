Date: 7/8/2007Location:  Room 7, Robannas




After one hell of a hiatus, we finally got back together for a rehersal. It took a while since Rich Bitch seems to be out of order at the moment (why can't we find out whats going on?! Oh yeah, too lazy).




Anyway, we tried out Robannas in town (which is NOT next to Sound Control, despite somone's instructions). Anyway, we made it there, hiked our gear up the mountain of stairs and got our room (you pay at the end..intriguing). The room left a lot to be desired. It was small, which wouldn't have been such an issue had the sun not been blinding us and making the room unbearably hot. So much so that we were all sweating like pigs. The gear wasn't much good either. The bass amp and head were a bit dated, and didn't seem to do a lot, plus the volume was all over the place. The guitar stuff was much nicer. The PA for the vocals?! A joke. The system was older than my amp, half the switches and dials were missing and the sound was just awful.




Anyway, we made do (even me without a tuner...probably was a bit off) and played our way through the usual songs. To be honest, our playing was rubbish. The vocals were rubbish. The room was too hot, we were all exhausted. It wasn't pretty




But it was good to get back together and play. We'll be trying out Madhouse next time, at least until Rich Bitch gets its act in order and we can get back there.




In the mean time, be sure to check out our [virb page](http://virb.com/douglasfurs) and have a listen to our songs, add us as friends, check out the photos and watch us playing Birclock live.
