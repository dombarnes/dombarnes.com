Well its now Day 25 (of January at least) of my 31 days of photographing myself. So far I've managed to miss a few days in rush/laziness. So far I've taken and uploaded 19 photos in the 25 I've been doing this.  To make it to 31, I'll just extend it to February.For  the rest of the year I want to do other mini-projects so I'm looking for ideas. Maybe photos of buildings around the town, flora and fauna, things like that. If you have any suggestions, please leave me a comment here. So stay tuned for more photo projects on Flickr and check out my Self Portrait set [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/domster83/sets/72157603644268373/)
