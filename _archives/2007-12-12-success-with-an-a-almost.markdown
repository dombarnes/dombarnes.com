So today was the culmination of about 14 months of slow studying towards my [CompTIA A+](http://certification.comptia.org/a/default.aspx). Today I took my 220-601 A+ Essentials exam. And I am glad its over.
I arrived at the test centre (thanks to the kind people at [New Horizons](http://www.newhorizons.com/content/index.aspx), Birmingham) and within 30 seconds of arriving, the fire alarm went off, so I had to stand out in the cold for 20 minutes before I got started. But we went back inside, and I got to it.




I took the sample exam, which was too much really. 15 questions on the universe (none of the answers were [42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#In_literature)), and then got stuck into the actual exam. I blasted through the 100 multiple choice questions in about 20 minutes, then spent another 20 reviewing my answers, making some changes and then ended the test. And there it was on the screen. I've passed! Scored 780 out of 900 so did quite well considering I was half expecting to fail.




Only query, why did I get three questions, all relating to anti-static wrist straps? Seriously are they worth testing that much? Not that I complained. A few easy questions.




Now I've gotÂ  90 days to sit the 220-602 IT Technician exam and then I'm fully qualified. That means I'm job hunting soon, and not soon enough.
