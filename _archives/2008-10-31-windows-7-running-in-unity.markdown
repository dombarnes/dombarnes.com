Hey all. Just a quick post to show you all the latest preview of Windows 7 running in VMWare Fusion on my Macbook Pro. As you can see, Unity mode is working a treat, except for the desktop gadgets




And you can also see that they've finally updated Paint! Even if its just to give it the ribbon interface.
