I was just catching up with my Google Reader feeds (re the UI changes: not a fan) and was scrolling through posts by one of my favourite writers at the moment, [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net). He had posted couple of links to people writing about how their iPad really is a replacement for their laptop. And then it struck me. I can't believe I hadn't even noticed before.




The new 2011 MacBook Air came with a few ports missing. Most people miss their FireWire (I do sometimes) or ethernet (I do sometimes) port, and there are solutions coming for this, beside's Apple's Thunderbolt display. But what else is it missing? A little port known for its fondness of Kensington locks. The rectangular hole in many people's laptops is often overlooked, but for some people, like college students, or small offices (or even big offices) this is critical to reducing the change of your precious laptop being stolen. But my MacBook Air doesn't have this.




There could be two explanations to this.




1. There simply wasn't enough room in the tiny case to make an extra hole. Besides, 5 is too many anyway.
2. Its so small and light, that there is no reason to need to lock it anywhere


Personally, I think its a little of both. I'm sure neither Jony Ive nor Steve wanted to make extra holes in the body of the Air, but when you're carrying around a 2.96lb laptop, is it ever really that problematic to take it with you?
