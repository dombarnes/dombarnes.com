Despite my avid [Mac-love](http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13509_1-9833273-20.html?tag=head), I do listen to a few Windows podcasts, since I will be working with them soon (call it wishful thinking). These include [Windows Weekly with Paul Thurrott](http://twit.tv/ww) (I used to read the blog a long time ago, back when XP was in beta!)
Anyway, I recently discovered [ITT](http://www.kevindevin.com) (In The Trenches) which is a great podcast for IT professionals, by IT professionals, where Kevin, George and a slew of other guest hosts,Â  chat about general IT stuff, like servers, mail systems, networks, qualifications, and share some handy tips, in fact it was [George](http://www.georgestarcher.com) who provided the [iPod Backup idea](https://www.georgestarcher.com/?p=114) and system.




Well, [this was their last podcast](http://kevindevin.com/?p=2478) recently as they're closing it down. Kevin's site is going to be reused for his own purposes as he moves on to a busy time in his life.




Anyway, wanted to post a thanks to them all for the great discussion and info they've given me over the past few months, and wish them both the best for the future.




Feel free to check out some past episodes before they vanish from the site.
