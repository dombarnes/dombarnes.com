I just logged on to Google Reader, my fave RSS client (Cheers [Chris Witherall)](http://massless.org/) and saw some new features. The first is Google Gears, which lets you view RSS stuff offline. Lets hope it comes to gmail. But it also offers up Trends data on your feeds. I had a browse and found this interesting.

I read most of my feeds at work, just when I get in, between 9 and 10. Thats not very productive of me. I also seem to read most on Thursdays.




Good news is I have 100% reading record! Well done me! Really loving that [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com)
