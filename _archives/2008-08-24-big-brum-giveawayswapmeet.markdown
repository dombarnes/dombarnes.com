Like a lot of people, I have a lot of stuff, and like a lot of people I care about what I throw out. But those two issues are very difficult to coexist.
Enter the Big Brum GiveAway/SwapMeet. The idea is simple, and much like a charity shop, you can take all those random bits and pieces, spare furniture, old CDs and DVDs you don't want, clothes etc, and give them away to anyone. You have a few tables set up at a pleasent location, people pay say 50p to enter and you can leave with whatever you want.
Everything is as you see it, there is no need to worry about pricing up items, it's a mad giveaway. Perhaps we can arrange some local drop off points in areas for those who don't wanna travel on the day.




Surely someone might want that dolls house or LP that you kept for some reason, or the one odd plate, or old cable that doesn't work with your new equipment. Well this could be the place to find it. And whatever is left goes to the nearest charity shop for second chance.




Is that a good idea? Has it been done?Is it anything better than giving to charity? Let me know what you think, if you would be willing to help for a few hours, or if you can offer a venue or tables or just a hand.
Or is this just the worst idea you can think of?
