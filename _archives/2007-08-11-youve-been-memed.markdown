I've been hit! Thanks [Grace](http://graceneedshelp.wordpress.com/2007/08/11/another-chance-to-talk-about-mememememememe/) for the tag. Guess I'll actually follow through on this one, not like [the last](http://graceneedshelp.blogspot.com/2006/12/book-tag.html)
OK. Here goes (is that one word or two?)
RULEZ!
A. Each person lists 8 facts/habits about themselves.
B. The rules of the game are posted at the beginning before those facts/habits are listed.
C. At the end of the post, the person then tags 8 people and posts their names, then goes to their blogs and leaves them a comment, letting them know that they have been tagged and asking them to read your blog.




Right.
1. I hate my job. Is that a good fact? What? Its not? Ok, I play bass. No good either? You've read the blog before? Ok, how about....until a few years ago I'd never had pasta (aside from out of a tin in sauce) or chicken. Thats right. My diet seemed to consist of frozen meals heated to perfection, and sometimes burnt. How closed my life was.
2. I tell bad jokes. Well not jokes so much as puns. I get it from my dad. We make the same jokes. How sad we are together (is that the first mention of my family? Not sure...)




<!-- more -->
3. Hmmm magic three. I used to play piano. Not a lot. Didn't even take the grade one exam. Lame I am
4. Habit - spend too much time online. Mainly reading blogs and rumor sites about tech/mac stuff. I like it, what can I say (and I hope to get paid for doing similar stuff one day)
5. I have a selection of stuffed toys. I have a [Sully](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_Inc), a [Mater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_%28film%29), and [Eleroo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wuzzles). Eleroo is the best. I got him when I moved to Norwich. He was sitting on my windowsill in my new bedroom. He rocks.
6. I was on TV and the radio before (my 10 secs of fame.). TV when I went on The Time The Place with my mum (I was very young and not at school for some reason) and radio when I answered the phone to Radio Broadland as they rang to wish my dad a happy birthday and noone told me (a theme which continued later in life)
7. I crack my knuckles a lot. Not interesting but I do it.
8. My nephew rocks! - OK, I know, another sell out. Sorry but I can't think of anything else. He's new, called Reuben, and he's a cool little dude.




Thats me done. The bad news is, I can't think of 8 people who blog who I could tag. So I'm gonna have to end it here. Sorry interweb-o-sphere community. This blogger has no blogs to comment at. Maybe is some of the readers left comments every once in a while i could refer back to them (hint, hint)
