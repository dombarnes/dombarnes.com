So I went shopping this afternoon for my girlfriend and came across two cards in two different shops. The first made me cringe and sigh dissapointedly, the second pointed out how far some companies and organisations go to be "PC".

This first card spouts the wonderful heartwarming sentiment, "Tinsel Tits". Now I've seen plenty of cards in my life, funny cards, slightly adult humour cards, innuendos with cartoon pictures and potentially rude comments, but then you get some that are just plain demeaning and disgraceful. This is the latter. I can't think of anyone I know who would appreciate a card calling them Tinsel Tits, let alone appreciate the picture of the semi-naked surgically enhanced woman on the front. Can't exactly put it on your mantle piece, unless you don't get visitors. But then this is a card for a woman isn't it?  Would you call your footie mates Tinsel Tits? So why would yor girlfriend want a card calling them that, with a semi-naked woman on the front? Would she want you staring at it when you were at home?




The second card is less harmless, but makes me smile that they are beginning to make cards for all relationship situations. There's boyfriend, girlfriend, sister and brother in law, sister and husband, and now, since divorce seems to be so high in this country, or single parenthood, there is now parent and partner, in this case, dad and girlfriend. How sweet. There was also brother and "partner". Why not put boyfriend? I didn't see any sister and partner so Hallmark obviously aren't catering to the lesbian society yet. I worry that it might only be another year before we see "dad and mail-order-bride" appear, or for mormen, "For my wives at Christmas". Why buy 6 when 1 will do?
