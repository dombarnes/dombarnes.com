Just a quick note to tell you all that I'm off on a weeks holiday to New York baby! We're going out on Saturday and will be back on Friday. Wifi may be available so don't count on too much happening with me online. I'll post photos to Flickr when I can, and will probably be doing a bulk upload when I get back. Follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/domster) to see what I'm up to
