Last Sunday, our friend, Gordon, took some photos of me and Katie for our wedding invites. He's been putting some up on Flickr as he's been editing them, and I wanted to point to this one, which I really like. And that in itself is surprising since because generally I don't like photos with me smiling. But this one's nice.
