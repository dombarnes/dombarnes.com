Shawn Blanc, now full time blogger, posts his extensive look at the HP TouchPad. If you're slightly curious about WebOS on a tablet device, then have a read.
It puts at rest my thoughts on WebOS. Aspects of the UI seem interesting to me, it looks like a nice blend of desktop UI and tablet UI, but it fails to deliver it seems. I'm especially interested in the Kindle App, given that its not an app, just a placeholder.
Keep trying HP
