Today is Women's No Pay Day. Its a day to make people aware that (as you see above) on average 17% of women are paid £4000 less than their male counterparts, thats the same as working for free from October 30th till the end of the year.




So please join in Fawcett and Unison's campaign to make people aware, and fight the blatent sexism that still happens in some workplaces. If you can, print of flyers from the website, tell people about the day or just be aware of it. And be sure to sign the [online petition.](http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/paygap/)
