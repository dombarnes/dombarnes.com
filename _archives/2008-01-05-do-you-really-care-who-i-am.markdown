Its been done [time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvDxUoadG6A) and [time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqVa4TDGCRc) and [time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YYaJIrmzo) again. I could do it again myself, but I'm lazy, so I've decided to do a 365 project of myself over 31 days, or at least January alone.
So [check out my Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/domster83/sets/72157603644268373/) for my photos. I'll probably post them every few days so don't bother checking daily! Plus am I really that interesting?
