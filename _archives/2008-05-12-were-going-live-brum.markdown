Recently I've found use in Upcoming.org as a method of finding cool events in Birmingham to go to, such as the Birmingham Flickrmeet, Blogger Meetups, and gigs. I've also been adding stuff myself, such as [Douglas Furs](http://douglasfurs.wordpress.com) gigs and [Midland MUG](http://www.mmug.org.uk) meetings in hopes of getting word out and getting more interest.
Well listings are limited currecntly. So big thanks and good luck to LiveBrum - the "comprehensive what's on event listings for the City of Birmingham, UK". Its a beautiful new website just launched recently where you can get all the info you want on concerts, shows, comedy, and any other public events in the Birmingham area, all nicely broken down into specific categories. So if you have a penchant for Jazz or Folk, you can get your fill here.

Its only just on its first legs (what is that referencing? do things have a second set of legs?) but there are some good features coming soon from what I hear.  

I'll be trying to get the Douglas Furs gigs on there too, but how happy was I to see our [Bar Academy gig](http://livebrum.co.uk/2008/05/29/catapult-club-presents-this-beautiful-thief-douglas-furs-barkerhound) on there already!

So if you find yourself looking for a nice night out, or just want to go see a band or some theatre on a sunday afternoon, then this has to be your first stop. So go check it out, sign up and get live!
