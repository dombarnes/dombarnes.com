So I've taken the initiative and recorded a few snippets of songs from our rehearsals to give you a small taste of some of our stuff. Be warned though: It was recorded on my Nokia 6280 so quality is really low. Abysmal almost.  And they're amr files so you may need to download [Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime) or [VLC](http://www.videolan.org) to listen to them. Enjoy though and drop me a comment
