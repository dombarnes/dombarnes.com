I hate Tiscali. I pay for 8Mbps unlimited download speed and because of "fair user policy", and cos I download a lot of podcasts and tv, I have had my speed capped during peak and off-peak times.Â  it means even loading webpages is dog slow.  
I could do with finding a cheap cable service that offers high speeds, no caps and no fair user policy.  

i don't understand why when the phone lines can actually support up to 24Mbps speeds, only one company i have seen will actually supply that speed. they'll give you as much as you can handle, and my netgear dg835g router can take that much.  

i'm curious to know what the typical net speeds are in the usa and other places cos i've heard some places say they only get about 4Mbps.
