Today I received a bit of bad news. My company has decided to close all its sales offices in the UK, and centralise the work in Manchester. This, as you can guess from the title, means bad news for me. My office, along with a few more from around the country will be closing in the next few months. We've entered a consultation period at the moment, and that will finish on 5th March. Then notice periods will be issued, or at least begin to be issued.
For me, this means that I will get my 1 month notice either in March or April. During that time, we'll have to pass on our group schemes to Manchester as they all get centralised up there. And then we will probably have to clear out the office, so relocate files, remove the literature supplies we have, the desks, computers, switches and servers, phones, chairs, and everything else. Everyone else in the office is in the same boat, so we'll all be looking for new jobs.




I guess I'm in a slightly better position as I'm already looking for new jobs in IT. But everyone else will have to adjust to the fact that we're being fired, and then get into job searching mode.




In terms of redundancy pay, since I've been there for 19 months, I should get about 5 weeks pay, which isn't fab, but its better than nothing and it should tide me over till I can get another job.




In the mean time, I'm sure business will dry up, and the attitude in the office will be low. No one is going to have the spirit to work particularly hard, which will make things more difficult.




So over the next few months I'll be blogging a bit more about my job, and keeping you reader(s) up to date with the comings and goings of my job. And of course my hunt for a new job. For now, I'm just dealing with it, and thinking about my trip to Athens that I will probably never get.
