I've just got back (a few hours ago) from my annual Sales Conference for work. Its the first one I've been to and it was out in Coventry. About 6 sales offices were invited and packed into one hotel. The actual event was a bit of a waste really. All political nonsense and broad general statements, not an educational informative day I though it would be.  
In the evening there was an African themed dinner and drinks and I have to admit, I had a few of those. I'm not a big drinker so I was only gonna have a few beers and then go to bed. But I had a few beers, then, I had a nice pot of tea (with the intention of then going to bed) but unfortunately I got plied with more alcohol in the form of gin/vodka and tonic/lemonade. The result was I talked a lot with my consultant at work who practicall poo-poo'd the fact that we were spending a whole 2 hour rehersal practicing songs we know and only getting through one new song a time. How cheeky! I was quite annoyed by this, thinking that we had been making good progress. Anyway, what does he know about being in a band. He also asked whether we had a manager which we don't, seeing as we haven't even played any gigs yet. All will come in time...
