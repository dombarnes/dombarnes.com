I finally got round to installing the GarageBand jam pack I got from Katie. Haven't really got time to try it out at the moment but when I get some time, I'm gonna try record some things, maybe Russia or Gouge Away and see what I can do with them.
It comes with loads of loops and software instruments so I should be able to get some good effects out of my bass, and with my overdrive pedal, I can get more. Its all coming together, just need time to devote to it. Hopefully, when I move,Â  I can get a mini studio set up, with my guitar, laptop, and all the leads I need to record music. Then get the other guys in and record the rest. Any suggestions for equipment would be good. I can get a Tascam cassette recording deck if I want from Katie's dad to help. Could do with a USB or Firewire Audio interface so we can jam and record it all at once.




Keep living the dream. This could be our year!
