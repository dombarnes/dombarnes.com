There's a lot of noise at the moment about Myspace and Facebook, and a few other services. They seem to be slowly declining.
Now I'm not the first to bitch about myspace. its a waste of mytime to be honest. Its a horrible web 0.1 website, which gets bombarded with horrible embedded music you can't stop, horrible animated gif wallpapers (dancing hampster anyone?), let alone all the whiny kids who just go on about nothing all the time.




Now i haven't tried facebook either, and doubt I will, but it seems similar. From what I gather you can tag people in photos, find old school friends (why? if I wanted to be friends with them still wouldn't i be? forget them and move on), and generally waste time.




Now there are lots of other services you can use to get a even better effect. Flickr for photos, geotagging, Worpress or blogger for blogging, tumblr for throwing in random things online, twitter to leave "away messages" or just tell everyone what you're doing at every minute of the day. Some of these are good, all of them seem to go their job better than deadspace ever could.




Recently, I've been using [Virb](http://www.virb.com). Its a well designed, much more functional, and easier to deal with social website. Its also a lot more band and music driven, so you'll find a fair few indie and independent bands on there, like Bloc Party, Modest Mouse, etc. If you're a band, you can post album info, band info, photos, shows, events, make announcements, upload songs for playing, or downloading, post videos, blog posts. Tons. Even if you're not a band, you can do a lot of this stuff. It seems like a great place for bands to get their music to people. Its also ideal for letting people know about shows that are happening,Â  along with tons of other info. So good, I've signed the Douglas Furs up [here](http://www.virb.com/douglasfurs). Its a bit sparse now but it will grow.




So have a look, [add me](http://www.vir/domster) or the band if you want, send me a message, check out the music in my playlist, and browse.
