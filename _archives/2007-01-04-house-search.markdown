Well its the new year and its about time to start looking for a new place to live. Our tenancy is up at the end of March as we just renewed it for 3 months so we can look for somewhere.
We want to move out of town, and into a more spacious 2-bed house in a nice suburban area. And we've found somewhere nice already. I saw it looking on primelocation.com and we're having a look next week. It sounds good and looks really nice. All we have to worry about is filling it with furniture. We're also looking for somewhere considerably cheaper than what we have at the moment and something near a train station. So not much really.




Its stressful at the best of times so Katie and I think we should give ourselves about 2 weeks to move. Thats likely to be one week of just evenings, and one solid week. Then we have plenty of time to do it (probably won't need that long though) and we can take it easy. We then need to clean this place as we got a few marks on the carpets.




Of course the main priority is getting some damn hot water. Its been almost 2 months now, having to travel to Katie's parents for a shower. Its not nice. I miss my morning shower, and knowing I probably smell good. The plumbers have been messing us around, really difficult to contact, but still I try.




Fingers crossed for some good plumbing this weekend and a nice house next week
