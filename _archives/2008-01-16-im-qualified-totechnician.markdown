That makes no sense but I just wanted to share my knowledge that today I passed bmy 220-602 IT Technician Exam and am now fully A+ qualified. So I have something extra to put on my CV/application forms now.
For information, it took me abotu 25 mins to go through the 90 multiple-choice questions, and then another 20 to review them. I passed with a 875/900 so a whopping 97%! Pretty good eh!




Well thanks to New Horizons on Edmund Street for putting up with me. Or at least taking my money for the exam!




From here, its job searches. But all thats gonna wait till the weekend.
