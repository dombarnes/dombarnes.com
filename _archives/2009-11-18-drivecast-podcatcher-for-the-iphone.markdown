![](http://blog.drivecast.eu/en/files/2009/07/bg_phone.png)Don't get me wrong, I love iTunes, and the iTunes app on my iPhone, but it bugs me that I can only download pocasts that are a) in the iTunes Directory, and 2) when iTunes has scanned the feed and detected a new episode. Sometimes that takes a while, sometimes its a day, but either way, I get impatient.
I've read a lot about RSS Player as a replacement but unfortunately this either isn't available right now, or is not available outside the USA. But, I did come across [DriveCast](http://drivecast.eu) [[iTunes Link](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322969074&mt=8)]. Its basically the same thing, but with some benefits.




After paying the minuscule sum of 59p for this app and installing it, when you first launch it, you're asked to login with your existing details, or are redirected to Drivecast.eu to sign up. As a new user, I went and registered, and confirmed my account with the auto-sent email verification. All pretty standard stuff.




Now, the interesting features. If you login to DriveCast.eu in your web browser, you're presented with a nice 3-pane view. The top is a menu bar, the left, is effectively a source list, leaving the main pane for what ever you're viewing. To get going, just hover over Add, and click Add Podcast. You're given the option to choose one of the 20 suggested podcasts, or clicking Other to add your own. Once you've done that, you choose the syncing settings, how many episodes to download, title, description, etc. Then you're good to go.




Back on the iPhone, after logging in, your device syncs with your account, and gives you a list of all the new episodes available. Clicking one gives you show info, a Play button, and a download button. Hit that and it immediately comes down, whether it be on Wifi or 3G, which means it conveniently steps over that iTunes 10MB limit they impose on 3G.




I've just started downloading a few shows, and it happily downloads while you listen to other shows. Of course, if you quit the app, the downloads stop until you relaunch it.




Back on the website, you can create playlists of shows and edit and delete existing show information. You can also upload files from your home PC to sync across to your device.




As well as that, you can set up recordings from your favourite internet stream. Select a country, language and pick a station, in my case I get a list of all the BBC channels. Then proceed to set up the date, and time of the show, set repeating times and you're done. That show can be recorded and downloaded to your device at any time.




The last feature I'll mention is that DriveCast is not just for iPhone and iPod Touch's. They also offer a small client you can download and copy to any USB drive, be it a flash drive or USB based MP3 player, allowing you to use any PC and internet connection to download new shows. They also offer Blackberry integration, syncing podcasts to your Blackberry via USB, a client for Nokia N800 and N810's, a RSS feed to your DriveCast library to manage your podcasts in your other chosen podcatcher, as well as Mac OS X and Linux clients, so you can get your podcasts anyway you want




So far, I have only found one issue. When viewing episode details, it doesn't parse HTML code correctly, so you see all the paragraph markers and break points, among other things.




Aside from that minute point, this is an excellent alternative to the iTunes app, and a real bargain at 59p. Worth checking out if you're struggling with iTunes, or to run on any other device.




As I browse the website, I notice more features I like. Definately a site worth a look if internet streams and podcasts are your thing
