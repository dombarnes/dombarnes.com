Well our 6 month lease on this house is up. And after all the trouble we've had, we're moving on. Its just too much to deal with. As well as all the trouble below, we live beside 2 large barking dogs which just isn't great. And the rent is too much for the place.
So what problems are these? Well..
1. The furniture we asked for wasn't supplied and we got stuff we didn't want.
2. There was about 1 working light bulb when we moved in
3. The front garden was a tip
4. See above but go out the back
5. The Let sign was left for about a month
6. The fridge broke down. It was brand new
7. The house was in a dirty state when we moved in
8. Spare carpet was left here
9. There was no TV socket or working phone line
10. The shower overheated WHILE I WAS USING IT and it could've fried me
11. The (no doubt cheap) toilet seat is broken
12. A kitchen cupboard handle was missing
13. There was a ton of brick dust left in one cupboard
14. The "new" bathroom is badly done. Poorly tiled, gaps between the tiles and the floor, uneven floor
15. We got one front door key. Thats it.
16. We got NO window keys - And only one opened
17. They used 4!! blinds in the front room downstairs
18. Do I need any more?
19. The timer on the heating doesn't work. So its all or nothing. So cold house in the morning
20. You need to flick a switch and wait at least 30 mins to get water hot enough to wash dishes
21. The general finishing work is useless
22. I recently spotted some damp in the lounge




And DAMN if I'm putting up with this. So we're moving to a nice new house. 2 bed terrace, carpeted floors, comfy, nice kitchen, nice bathroom. It'll be nice. And with a garden we can use too!
So we get the keys on 1 September, we'll be moving our stuff on the 8th. Need to buy a bed first so we have somewhere to sleep. Always important. Then we'll hand over the deathkeys to this place later that week, before rushing off for a week of [Nessie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessie) chasing in Scotland!




So be warned that activity will be low during the next few weeks while I pack, move boxes and furniture, subsequently unpack and try to get some sort of connectivity.
One last note, if all the rumors pan out, the iPhone will be announced in the next two weeks and I can start saving for mine. Luckily I'm out of my contract now so can quit at any time ("_[Why can't I quit you?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtykAMSCw7A)_")




Well thats almost all for now. Taking the car for its first MOT and tyre repair tomorrow. Then off for a slap up lunch courtesy of work for hitting targets. Got Â£150 for the three of us. So I'll be getting lobster!
Peace out. Save the Planet. Recycle.
