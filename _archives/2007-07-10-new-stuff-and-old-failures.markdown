It arrived (and by that I mean I picked it up) yesterday. I have my new MacBook Pro. Its shiney and lovely.Only problem now, and its a big one. I did a backup to DVD in May 07 (not really got any more robust backup facility) and had my discs sitting around for me, so last night I went to check them out. I put in the first DVD, and up popped Finder.

WHAT?!?! Its not fÂ£@king blank! I took the disc out and looked, and it had clearly been written to. So I popped it in my girlfriends MacBook and it just span around. Nothing. So I have one old failed backup.
I do have a working DVD of my photo library, but for the time being, only have the music on my iPod (so lost track counts, etc) and my photo library. I have some older backups, but they're not great.




For the time being, I'm trying various things to save my hard drive. I had a good 50GB in my user folder and i really want to get it back. The next stage of the operation is to remove the drive from the old Powerbook and pop it into a USB enclosure and hope to god something happens. Failing that, I might have to try a data recovery company but I don't know what that'll cost.




So for now, my Toshiba MK8025GAS 80Gb hard drive is dead or dying. Sigh :-(
