Just downloaded the Flock browser, built on the Mozilla framework. I hear about it a while back and never thought about trying it, but I think I will now.




Infact I'm blogging from the blogging feature on Flock now.




It has some interesting features, and supports extensions like Firefox so I think I'll give it a good test run.




I'll let you know how it goes. If there are any suggestions on it, let me know in the comments.
