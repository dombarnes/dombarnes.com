If you've been following my tweets, you probably already know about my car. If not, read on.Two weeks ago, we were at our usual Monday night pub quiz. We arrived at 8 after picking up some groceries. The quiz started at 9pm as usual, and at about 9.10, they made an announcement, that slowly filled me with dread. "Would the owner of a Toyota Yaris..." Please don't be me "...registation AB01 XYZ come up to the front please". At that point I nervously stood up and walked forward. My initial thought was I was somehow parked in someones way, but as I saw the face of the bar staff, I felt worse.
"Is it bad?" I asked
"Pretty bad" she replied and I walked outside.
What I was greeted by was my car, pushed into the side of a white van parked next to it, with a huge impact dent in the drivers side back door. At first I couldn't believe it, having just had the front door fixed after someone reversed into it. The following few minutes were mixed with shock, process logic and reports from onlookers. While my car had a big dent. the other driver was no where to be seen. They had driven off.




With some good luck, the bar staff had seen the car after it happened, seen it drive off and taken down the license plate and make and model of the car. I was also fortunate to have a number of witnesses who came up to me and told me bits of what happened and left contact details. And potentially hopefully, I was told CCTV footage should be available from cameras in the car park. So I spent the remainder of the night being very pissed off, waiting for the Police to show. Unfortunately they did not. They did ring back and say to go to my local station to report the incident, and pick up a self claim form.




So I filled in my report form, called the insurance company and made a start on all the boring stuff after a car accident. I was asked to take my car for assessment in Lye which I did. The initial prognosis from the engineer was it was close to a total loss. It took another few days for the insurance company to confirm this to me, and then a few more days before it was collected.




There is some good news coming from this. I took out some additional policies on the car, one for a Hire Car in the event of a write-off, which gives us a car for 3 weeks to use. Very helpful for getting around to car dealerships. And one for Top Up Cover, to pay out an additional sum in the event of a write off. We also had GAP Insurance, that covers us for the difference between the value of the settlement, and the loan settlement amount. Although it looks like we won't need this.




So at this moment, I am waiting, hoping that the other driver will now accept liability, and my insurance company can claim their costs back off them, and I can get my excess back. And that the Police pursue the issue and that the driver is held accountable in some way for the trouble s/he has caused me.




And now, we're getting a new car, which I'm actually excited about. We're getting a Mazda, a brand of car I never thought I'd own, nor be able to afford, but its a lovely little car, feels great to drive, and I look forward to driving around in it.




I am usually sceptical and cautious over the additional policies they sell with car insurance, but in this case, it seems to have paid off.
