Just a quick post here. If you have an iPhone, and have updated to the 2.0 software, be sure to checkout the new Wordpress application. It's a lovely little app for blogging on the go.It supports wordpress.com and self hosted domains and will store your drafts locally if you don't have time to finish them.
You can easily add multiple blogs so now there is no excuse for me not to post
Wordpress for iPhone is free from the App Store.
