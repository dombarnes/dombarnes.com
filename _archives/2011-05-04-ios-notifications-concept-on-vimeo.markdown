A few comments on this idea.
1. It requires a double-press and swipe to reach the notifications screen. And adds another swipe to be able to access the iPod and volume controls that already exist.
2. The UI on the lock screen feels more integrated into the OS, rather than making the users feel like the notifications are also in a new app (and do we need a whole app for this?)
3. The idea that I would go into the "Notifications" app, to view my Twitter notifications, then switch into Twitter seems to be a few extra, unnecessary steps.
4. Confuses users with the Slide to view information box that resembles the Slide to Unlock bar, mimicking the UI but not the functionality.
5. Doesn't look like a 3 year old designed it, like [this](http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b334/csnight/REDO_CONCEPT.jpg).




My suggestion on this problem is this:
From your home screen, you see a visual cue that there is a notification (status bar perhaps). You swipe right from screen 1 to the current search screen. You see the usual search box, as well as a list of notifications for each app, similar to how they appear on the lock screen of this video. In the top right corner is an X in a circle to clear all notifications, and you can scroll through the list to see each notification




This system would keep the notifications as part of the iOS, rather than subjugate Â then into a whole "app" It also adds more use to the Search screen, which feels unloved at the best of times. It is also gives iOS the ability to infer more content right of the first home screen. You could perhaps swipe right again to view some widgets maybe? Perhaps put a weather widget, and iPod controls here on a second screen to the right?
