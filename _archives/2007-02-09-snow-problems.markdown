why does snow cause such problems to travel and the world?Â  two reasons:
1. because people think they can drive the same as normal, and go sliding all over the place
2. because other people try to jump traffic by performing stupid maneuvers that cause more trouble for everyone else




today is another such day. the second day of snow in birmingham this year, and my first snow in birmingham (look at my flickr pics), and people are really struggling. the gritters were out but it takes more than grit to make the roads work, and as my girlfriend pointed out, you can't grit when the trucks are stuck in traffic.




i think a few things are needed. if more people would be prepared to scrape the footpaths, then at least people wouldn't fall over so much, and there would be a bit less trouble. if drivers were a bit more prepared for cold weather (not even all the time, just when we're warned about it in advance) and took ice scrapers, de icer, a blanket, etc, then there wouldn't be so much worry about being stuck in snow.




of course some snow plows would help too. but since we're only getting about 6 days of snow a year, is it worth it? but global warming is another matter.
