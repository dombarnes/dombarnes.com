Twitter streams in the UK have been bombarded with reports and discussion on the News of the World scandal, where a former editor was accused of hiring a private investigator to hack into peoples mobile phones and voicemail services to further a story. There are also accusations of paying the police for information.
While there is a lot to be said about that, around the morality of a newspaper and how far they can and should go to pursue a story, I'm more concerned with how massively people have erupted with opinons on the matter. Moreover, how a lot of companies are now under scrutiny even though they are unrelated to the story in question.

There seems to be a mass assumption being made that any news story that a person deems as important, is purposefully being buried by the company by announcing it while a bigger news story is going on. But would you really expect a big company to rush through all its 'bad' news at such a time just in the hope that it gets buried by the lead?




In the example of British Gas' price hike, such a change would have been planned weeks ago, and likely the press release and announcements were already prepared. What is more likely is that it was just bad timing, or rather a coincident that caused the announcements to overlap. If British Gas had a press release planned, why would they think about delaying it just to make sure it got proper news coverage? Equally, would they have had the lead time to get all the press information ready between the lead story hitting and before it died off?




To me, thats unlikely.




But the other side of this, is the rumours circulating that The Sun will start producing a Sunday newspaper. Such rumours were greater fueled bu the fact that SunonSunday.co.uk and TheSunonSunday.co.uk were registered two days before news came out that NotW was closing, at a time when Rupert Murdock was still backing his staff at NotW. Is it not just as likely that some bright spark with Â£10 to spare went to 123-reg.co.uk and bought the domains, as a prank, or thinking that it could happen, and hope to sell the domains to News International for a premium? This is a age old money-game called Domain Parking, and many companies have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds to obtain a domain for their company. Certainly the WHOIS details for the domain don't offer any suggestion that its been bought by News Int. The registrar is private, to a UK Individual, named Mediaspring, a company name that doesn't seem to exist in Companies House. I would also wonder if the Web Department at News International, or News Corp, would really use 123-reg.co.uk?




Similar domains, such as TheSundaySunPaper.co.uk has been registered on 8th July 2011, and points to a landing page, stating that the domain is for sale. Beyond wild speculation, I see no evidence that the registration of a few domain names by an unknown party equates to a new edition of The Sun.




The main point here is that it doesn't take much for wild speculation on Twitter, or other social media websites, to spread quickly, and can often tar a company with a bad reputation. One unhappy customer, or mischievous individual can cause damage to a commercial business. Moreso, as TV news programs tie into Twitter more, they further open themselves to wild speculation, as the information coming from them is no more than a 3rd or 4th hand source.




Of course, all this being said, Twitter has proven itself a useful news source, in fact when a plan crash-landed in the Hudson River in NYC, it was a user of Twitter who caught the first photo, providing second-hand evidence of the event, and getting his photo seen on countless news shows and in newspapers and magazines.




So maybe its not all bad, but maybe, we just need to be a bit more careful about the rumours we spread, and what we RT.
