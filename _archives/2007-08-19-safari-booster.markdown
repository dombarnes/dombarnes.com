So I've recently been trying to use Safari more effectively, as it is a lovely browser and much quicker than Firefox IMHO. To do this, I've installed various plugins. And here's what. Credit to [Merlin Mann](http://43folders.com/tags/safari) for some of these.
Firstly, you need to install SIMBL which is a plugin manager. [Go to here](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) and follow the instructions.




For all these, you need to download the plugin, and copy the *.bundle file to ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins




[SafariSource](http://www.tildesoft.com/Misc.html) - Adds colour marking to the View Source windows to make reading the source much easier.
[SafariStand](http://hetima.com/safari/stand-e.html) - Adds massive support for a preview sidebar of tabs open, quick search key commands, flash/plugin blocking, Bookmark Shelf so you can bookmark a whole workspace of websites and launch easily later
[TabStop](http://nukethemfromorbit.com/applications/TabStop.html) - Asks you if you want to close all tabs when more than one is open (nice save for those keyboard happy people)




In addition to those, i have also:




[Sogudi](http://www.kitzkikz.com/Sogudi) - adds abbreviation use for specific website search, so 'gg chris pirillo' searches Google, 'am long winters' searches Amazon.co.uk, 'wk lost' searches Wikipedia for Lost. Completely customizable, add your own websites, just remember the short codes.
[Inquisitor](http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/) - Fantastic plugin for the search bar. Adds spotlight style functionality, giving you search results as you type, and search suggestions. Also will tell you the sites you visited directly from the search box (nice if you forget which one you looked at)
[SafariBlock](http://fsbsoftware.com/) - Allows you to block website content (ads for instance). Worth checking out [this page](http://www.coppit.org/blog/archives/177) for a good starting list of sites to block, or add your own.
[PithHelmet](http://www.culater.net/software/PithHelmet/PithHelmet.php) - Useful program for blocking plugins for ads on websites




Well thats it. I haven't really tried the Safari Beta yet cos I'm happy with my setup. My only one complaint of Safari is that some of the Google apps don't work properly (alignment in Calendar, no Docs support, no chat from gmail.)
