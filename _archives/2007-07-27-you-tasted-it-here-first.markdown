On tuesday I took the plunge. I thought I should probably blog this so its here for eternity that it started with me.
So what is the big story? Its my new drink. I was in Coffee Republic on tuesday and thought I would have a Hot Chocolate and I usually have syrup for taste. And today's choice? STRAWBERRY!




So before the new wave sweeps the nation, you heard it here first. Strawberry Hot Chocolates. Its been approved by a CR employee, and my girlfriend, and its only a matter of time before more people try this, perhaps even prompted by this post.




Its been quoted as tasting like "the strawberry one in a box of Roses"




So enjoy, and leave me your thoughts in the comments
