I just saw this pop up online from Dave Slusher who does the fantastic [Evil Genius Chronicles ](http://evilgeniuschronicles.org)blog and podcast. He's got together with a group of locals to pull together their own new media event, to bring similar style activities you see at SXSW. In his own words,  “the [Grand Strand Bloggers](http://www.grandstrandbloggers.org/) are throwing themselves a party and seeing who dances.”
So I wanna spread the work about [CreateSouth ](http://www.createsouth.org)and urge you to attend if you're nearby.




Dave's done what I have recently though I would like to see in the UK as well. There are loads of these conferences in the US, [SXSW](http://sxsw.com/), [PodCamp](http://podcamp.pbwiki.com/), [Bar Camp](http://barcamp.org/), Twitter Meetups, [ConvergeSouth](http://2008.convergesouth.com/), and so many bloggers, podcasters, content creaters in the UK just don't get to attend. This morning I thought it'd be good to see a WestByWestMidlands start up here, in the same suit as SXSW and CreateSouth that Dave has helped to get rolling. An event with something for everyone. Music, films, sociology, education, the whole works. Just somewhere you can come and listen to people speak about their industry, ask them how to get started them selves, get ideas and tips for improving your own business, blog, podcast or other. Somewhere to go and learn how to make a short video for Youtube or [Viddler](http://www.viddler.com), to learn about digital photography from the beginning, to learn how to get blogging and podcasting, and generally share knowledge and have a good time.




I'm hoping one year I'll have enough time and money to go to SXSW perhaps but for now, I'll watch from afar and support Dave who's bringing some of this to the South east.




So if you fancy it, go and [get registered!](http://www.createsouth.org/registration.php)
