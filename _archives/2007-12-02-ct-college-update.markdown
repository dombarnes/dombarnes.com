I had a letter back from the Computer Training College today.
Bad news.
Firstly, they went into administration on 26 September 2007. So if thats not a clue to NOT JOIN THEM, what is?




Secondly, they completely ignored my actual complaint and only addressed one issue of my original letter to them.
So what now? Now I'm going to reply to them with some strong words. These companies hope that they can fob you off first time and you'll back down, so remember to be persistent. Continue to  argue your point to them.




So lets give it another go.




Peace out
