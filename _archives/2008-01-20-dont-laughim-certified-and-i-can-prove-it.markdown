As per my previous post, I'm not a certified A+ IT Technician. And as a A+ Certified IT Technician I am now entitled to use the CompTIA A+ Certified IT Technician logo. It can be used on business cards, Resumes, CV's, applications, letters, and some other stuff. Not a bad way to remind your clients or potential employers that you have formal qualifications that are recognise globally.
I've also requested my IT Technician Kit. I presume this includes my certificate, but it certainly sounds like I get something else. I'm looking forward to seeing what other gems I get sent, and I'll be sure to let y'all know.
