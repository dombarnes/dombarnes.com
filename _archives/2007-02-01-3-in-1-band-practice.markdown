Ok, I've been really slow in posting about practice recently so I'm combining 3 in one.

This was probably my worst practice yet. I got back from my [work conference](http://domster83.wordpress.com/2007/01/17/conference/) at 12, didn't sleep much the night before and was slightly hungover. But dedicated as I am, I went to practice. And it was shocking. I was so lathargic when I was there, I completely forgot how to play Nick's new song. Shit. I just stood there not knowing what I was meant to be playing, confused, although I think I came off as pissed off more than anything, the guys certainly thought I was. The Red room was different, it was downstairs, had a small stage for the drum kit which was nice, gave me something to wander around, although the amps were on the stage as well so it was kinda weird, kept thinking I'd pull mine off if I walked too far away. Didn't feel like I got much done. We didn't get anything new done, it was more just playing what we knew.

Much better! The old favourite room. So much better. Bilby was there at first (he's the old bassist, left to join a different band, I stepped in), and he sat there for a while and listened to us. Got a good response, although we were a bit off at first, some drum slips, and a few forgotten lyrics didn't make us look all that impressive. Anyway, Bilby went, and we carried on. Mainly worked on the two new songs, didn't write anything new, jammed a bit. We're getting more structure to Nick's song (still nameless I think) and played the Cursive like song, which has partially been named Hope/Birdclock. James and I though Hope was good, cos it is a slightly sad song but gives you hope when you listen to it. Nick just liked Birdclock as a song name. Anyway, went to the pub afterwards, then mosied on home.

Another good session, although it got off to a bad start. I got there on time, if not early, and Chris was having drum problems. The latch on the snare drum was broken so the springs weren't staying tight. So I ran around trying to find a spare, and was told to switch it with the one in the Burgandy room, so we finally got that sorted out. Before that, before I even arrived, the stool was already duff and had been fixed as well. So after wasting about 20 mins fixing stuff, we finally got started, played the set through, went through a few hiccups, some bad playing of Gouge Away, and more work on Hope and the other one (it has a name, I just can't remember it). In between playing and resting though, James thought it would be fun to play his guitar with a drum stick. Bad move. Broke the high E string so had to run off, get a new one, and string it up, only the old string end was stuck in the casing so we had to mess around trying to get that out. Finally did, and then it was completely out of tune, and he and Nick both struggled to get it right. But there was no time to sort it as Mark came along to listen too, since Bilby came before. Again, not the best session to promote us, James messed some words up, and was out of tune, I missed a few notes, and went a bit awry a few times on Gouge Away.




We finally finished off in the pub for a drink, which usually helps relax us. No practice this week, as Nick and Chris are away so we're on two week hiatus. Which might give me a chance to blog about something else. Look out for my Three saga coming soon.
