I've been following this story since I saw it appear on Digg the other week. A news reporter from CNET was missing with his family after they were coming home from a holiday. The family were last seen at a diner near Roseburg before heading off on the last leg of their journey. Unfortunatly they never arrived and their family notified the police.
A search began and on Monday, the wife, Kati, and his two daughters were found by their car, after Kati waved an umbrella at a passing helicopter. The search then continued for James.




Unfortunately, he was found 11 days after heading off into the wilderness on wednesday 6th December. He hadn't made it. The story of his braveness, his efforts to save his family, who were so important to his life, has rippled accross the internet. Stories and thanks have been pouring in, as well as messages for his wife and kids, Penelope and Sabine.




My thoughts go out to his family and friends who will surely miss him.
