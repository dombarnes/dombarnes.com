I'm an Apple fan. Thats no secret. I like the products, I like the design, the interfaces, the simplicity and yet ability to be powerfully complex. I like the whole shebang (sp?). I also liked the new "[Get A Mac](http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/)" adverts they started a while ago.




My problem with these, however, is only a recent event. Up until about 6 ads back, they were more focussed on features that the Mac could offer over Vista, such as MS Office native, iWork, Time Machine, Boot Camp, the version simplicity. But recently, the ads seem to have dropped into the realm of Vista-bashing.




That being said, I'm not a massive fan of Vista, or Windows at all. But I use it, and I admit that Vista does have some advantages over XP. I recommended it to my mum in fact (largely on the basis that XP support will dwindle so best to jump on board sooner).Â 




Surely Apple can come up with better ads, and features to push, like Photobooth, Garageband, iChat, Screen Sharing, all of which are great features to plug, rather than spending time and money on ads going on about unhappy Vista customers and Vista bugs.




Perhaps we can band together and make them come up with some engaging adverts instead?
