Remember a while ago when I was losing my job? Well that happened, an I was unemployed. And that was fun. I saw a few films, relaxed and just wasted my time. Until one day later when I had a job interview. And then 2 days later, I started again.
My title is now PC Installations Engineer, although my security badge says ICT Technician, but same difference. So I spend my time installing new PC's, replacing old ones, and transferring data. Oh and I have spent a lot of time fixing printers.




While it may not be the most exciting or detailed job, its a start in the industry, and its experience for me which is the main thing.




The hope is that while I do this, I can study for my Network+ and by the last quarter of the year, I should be qualified and that should help me get a better job.




What have I learnt so far? Well roaming profiles are VERY important to a network, all users should NOT be given admin priviledges, and internet ports should be closed (iPlayer, Torrents) - basically the network at my work is not great by any means. Data transfer involves, pulling out the old drive, copying user folders to a new folder on the new machine, and leaving a text file on the All Users desktop with instructions, involving logging on and off, using the generic IT logon, and copying files across. Its by no means nice. And of course you have HUGE internet cache's to deal with too.




So in the mean time, I'll be hauling Dells. And I must say its really tiring.
