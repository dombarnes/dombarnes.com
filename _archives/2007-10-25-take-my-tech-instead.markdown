I recently saw over at [Philoking](http://www.philoking.com) that Jason had a launched a website [Take My Tech](http://www.takemytech.com), where he was giving away some tech bits and pieces for free. Shipping was being subsidised by Google AdSense so there was no reason to charge.
In that light, I've decided to start my own mini-Take My Tech. I'll be offering up some bits and pieces I have accumulated over the years and offering them to you, the reader for free.




If you want the item, then just leave a comment, and supply a valid email address and you could get it.




Jason was going to 100 comments then choosing a random winner. For the sake of the low readership, I'll keep it to 10 for the start. If it gets popular, then I might increase it.




So stay tuned for some free stuff!
