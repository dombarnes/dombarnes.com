So at work we won this campaign and got Â£3000 to spend on a day out for the office. We ended up going to Garlands Leisure in Leicestershire.  
My morning started out early, at 6am, when I woke up, as I had to be at work for 8am to get a minibus to the centre. When we arrived, we all piled into the reception room, signed away our lives, and dumped our bags. We were then split into two teams, and went off to do different activities. The first for me was Quadbiking. It was fun. We did figure of 8's first to get used to the bikes, then did a few test runs, then did a 3 lap timed run, and a final lap of victory. How did I get on? Well see below

As you can see I greatly improved on the second run. The best time was done by Ben who got 1.34 seconds. So my score was respectable I think.  

After that we did laser clay pigeon shooting. We used decomissioned rifles which had been fitted with lasers for reuse. Again we did some practice shooting, 25 rounds, with dual shot rifles. Then we went onto the scoring round. First round was simple, 2 points for the first shot, and 1 for the second, so you could get up to 75 points in this round. I think I got about 37. Second round, fastest guns. Clay goes up, first shot on it gets 5 points, 2nd gets 4, and so on for the first 5 shots. So you can get up to 175 maximum (9 points if you get the first two shots), again I did quite well, about 85ish I think.  

Last game was sudden death. Clay goes up, first shot takes 2 points. Thats it. I came out with a reasonable 8, compared to 14 by the winner.  

Lunch time came next. A barbecue had been put on (although we didn't see the grills so questionable) but I chowed down on burgers, sausages and chips.  

In the afternoon we did off road dirt karting. That was rough. The track was really bumpy and it was a little frightening. Did ok there. 1.45 was my best time.  

Afterwards, we did archery, and having done this before at scout camp, I was used to it. So I took my shots like a pro! Well I did alright. Again, we did some warming up, then went for scoring on the targets. Three different sizes, scoring as normal. And would you know it, I came third in the group. I was only about 7 points off second, and a quite a few off first (Pete hit a bull for 25 on his last shot)

At the end of the (exhausting) day we went back to the reception room for the prize giving. Our team did well, and I bagged the medal for 3rd best overall in the archery, so that meant all our team got medals in that.  
The best thing was that our team got best overall and won the cup! And I brought it home!
