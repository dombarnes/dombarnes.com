So ever since the news came out at work about there being redundancies, the office has been really quiet. Consultants and IFA's alike are staying clear of the office, only coming in when they really have to. And work wise, its been dead. So much so that I have spend a large portion of the last three days sitting around staring at my empty inbox and todo list seeing that there is nothing I can do right that moment.
So what did I do today? Well besides checking my account to see that I had been paid, I read some of [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0749922648/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204147739&sr=8-1) by [David Allen](http://www.davidco.com). I also looked on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/search/?q=moleskine&w=all) and on some blogs for [Moleskine](http://amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=moleskine&Go.x=0&Go.y=0&Go=Go) ideas.




I got my first Moleskine at Christmas and haven't actually done anything with it yet. But today I started on that. I printed outÂ  a handy year planner, as well as setting up some pages. To keep in line with GTD ideas, I've got my Next Actions page, Someday/Maybe lists, as well as a Douglas Furs page where I have made some notes about the band. Have a look at the photos below.

I'm gonna try and keep this up to date as best I can, and use it as much as possible. At first I felt bad about using it for such reasons but then I saw some photos on flickr of peoples piles of Moleskines and just thought "Well I can get another one a year down the line".
