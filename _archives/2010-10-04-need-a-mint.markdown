If you live in the US of A, you have [Mint.com](http://Mint.com), a website that integrates with your banks to pull together all your account details, giving your a portfolio overview, and detailed view of your finances. If you live in the UK, Mint.com doesn't work asit only supports US banks. But we do have some options.I had been using two services before, [Kublax.com (now offline)](http://www.kublax.com/) and [Buxfer.com](http://buxfer.com). Kublax actually went out and pulled in data directly from UK bank accounts, once you hand over your login details (yes I was dubious but went ahead - they only had read-only access). Not long after I started using it, the site shut down after being unable to make money from it. So I went back to Buxfer. Buxfer does support the direct bank integration, but like Mint, only works in the USA. I had been using the site for a few months, downloading QIF files from my banks and then importing them into Buxfer. I loved the ability to see the overall value of my accounts, including loans I was paying off, see charts for wealth levels during the month and years. It was a great service.
It could still be a great service, but after some downtime last weekend, I did some googling and found out that the since guy who built the site was now working for Facebook, and so it seemed unlikely there would ever be any new features or ongoing support.
I couldn't risk losing data on someone else's terms so I exported all my transactions to QIF and deleted my account.
The replacement I found was [Money Strands](http://money.strands.com) - it seems like a fantastic replacement for Kublax. It takes your online banking login details and pulls in all your accounts, balances and the most recent transactions (no way at the moment to import history). It then categorizes your transactions into a number of groups and topics. If the right tag isn't there, you can add your own, as well as changing untagged or incorrectly tagged items. With that, it builds you a few budgets for groceries and Bills. This immediately helps you keep an eye on what you spend, or hope to spend in a month on a given area. I made some changes to my budgets and now can see how my spending is going throughout the month.

Another wonderful feature is the Reports you can get. On the Overview page, you have access a couple of PDF reports of your finances, showing current balances, income and expense levels over a number of months, as well as charts breaking down your spending. These are perfect to review or share with a spouse to see how spending is going, or even take to the meeting with the mortgage advisor or bank manager.

The final piece of the puzzle is the [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moneystrands/id306480796?mt=8). It lets you login and view this information with a native app (Buxfer has an app but its just a Webkit view to the mobile website), keep track of bugdets, view alerts, notifying you when you've had large transactions you want to monitor, as well as maintain the Cash transaction log. This is basically a separate account that is filled with cash values when you mark another transaction as a ATM/Cash Withdrawl. To balance this account, you need to enter in all the purchases you make with that cash. Its a great way to monitor that spending you don't see on bank statements, when you buy a coffee with change, or a few groceries with a tenner. However after my first import, I had Â£50 in my cash account which I have no clue where I spent so can't categorise. If you accept that downfall, and just put a debit in to zero-out the account, then you can track your spending from the day you start using it.

So does it come up to scratch with Mint.com? Well I think so. The fact I get push notifications when it picks up a large transaction is great, or when my balance drops too low, the fact I can track my little purchases easily is great, and its very nice to be able to see a overview of my financial situation in one place.

If you can get past handing over your bank login information, then this is a great service to use.
