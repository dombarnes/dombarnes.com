So back at the start of January, I wrote about my mini-365 project, and we've now gone past the 1 month banner. So check out the [flickr set](http://flickr.com/photos/domster83/sets/72157603644268373/) for the full photos.




You'll be able to see the ever changing hair length, and notice when I got my hair cut, and the varying facial hair choices I make. Its fun to see (at least to me)




Having done it this far, someone said why not carry on. So I've decided to continue and do this, but not every day, (partly because I forget), but I'll try and do one or two a week. I also want to start a new project.




I think that my next photo project will be the home. I plan to take photos of something in my house, a bit odd or interesting, for 30 days. So check out [the new flickr set here](http://flickr.com/photos/domster83/sets/72157603893983847/) to see them as the get added.




Leave me your thoughts on the photos or here on the blog.
