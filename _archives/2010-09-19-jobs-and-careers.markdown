When I left education at the age of 18, I spent some time doing odd jobs, picking books in a warehouse, cleaning shelves, and working on the checkouts at Sainsburys during the Christmas period. Clearly this wasn't going to be enough to pay the bills and live on, so I got a job with Norwich Union, doing pensions admin. 3 years later, I was still there, but a move to Birmingham pushed me out of that job. To make the transition easier, I took a new job in pensions again, working on the sales side of the business later.
Cut to 20 months later and I was being made redundant from my job. It was 2008 and the economy was on its way down. My employer cut me, and everyone else in my office, loose. I took this as a chance to make real change of career, and managed to get a job in IT, an industry I wanted to work in for years, since before Norwich Union. I took a contract job doing installations for the NHS, and did that for 4 months before getting a more permanent job doing desktop support for a private firm. I did that for 2 years, the first 18 months of which were rolling 3 and 6-month contracts. During this time i had pursued other jobs, in case my manager decided I was superflous.




And that takes us to today. Next week I start my last full week of work for this company before I leave to pursue a similar job, in an industry and role that I think could hold a lot for me. I'll be joining a new company as their first technician, performing Mac desktop, laptop and server installs for their various clients. Needless to say, I'm very excited. I've been a Mac user since 2004 (2003 if you count my first iPod) and working mostly with Windows up until now, I see how painful it is to work with, so I'm very excited that my new job is working with and support Macs.




I honestly cannot wait to get started. This is a great chance for me to gain formal training with Apple and experience working with them, as well as having a hand to shape the future of the company, and define my own career path. Not only will I be doing on-site installations for clients, but I'll be building the backend systems to help improve the workflow, creating predefined images for companies to use, making workflows and scripts to help administer and integrate with existing systems.




All this starts in October. I'm taking some time off between jobs, using up some annual leave, and going to see my folks for my birthday, and just relaxing and unwinding between careers.




I'm really grateful for the chances I've been given by the people I've worked with, and have learnt a lot from them, and hopefully taught them a few things too.




I'm hoping this will allow me more time to blog here. I'm also working on a new project, which I hope to have launched in the next month or so. It could turn into something, or nothing. But its probably worth the time investment. So stay tuned for more.
