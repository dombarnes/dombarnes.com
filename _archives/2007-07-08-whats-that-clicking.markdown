I figured it was a good time to do a general whats going on post.This weekend my gf has gone to a work do so I'm left all alone for the rest of sunday and monday till she gets back. So what do I do? Well I'm currently blogging, been looking at some guitar tabs trying to learn some songs and just get better at playing.
Of course I'm doing this on katie's Macbook. Why not mine? Because my poor powerbook is suffering again. On friday it started acting really slowly. I thought maybe the swapfiles were just too huge so rebooted, and then it was all downhill. It took forever to boot and was really REALLY slow to respond. I've tried a few things to see whats going on, but can't figure it out. I ran FSCK to see how the disk was holding up, and it seems fine, but it is making these clicking noises all the time. I am just worried that it got wet on thursday and is suffering because of it.




What was thursday? It was the fruit of my hours spent editing video and finding the right music (copyright free of course) for this work thing in the morning, where we had to present "6 star" at our office and i had some clips of people at work to sort out. So I had my laptop with me at the hotel on thursday for the morning, and then we had a surprise event in the afternoon, which turned out to be a fun scavenger/treasure/photo/quiz trail around Birmingham. The biggest worry now is when I ran from Paradise Forum to the ICC/Symphany hall to hunt for answers and of course since the weather has been so crap, it was raining in a biblical sense. So I was running around with my laptop on my back, and I think it might be suffering because of it.




I've also had a stressful week at work, making these stupid packs for MR (my consultant). I've got about another 8 hours of solid work to do on them, and have already spent about 2 solid days, and wasted mountains of paper, due to changes in the documents being used.
This really isn't what I want to do with my life. Its a waste of anything good I can do, and its making me miserable. At the moment I can't leave. Well I can but I need to stick around till I find something else, or at least get my bonus in September. Then I'm out of there and hopefully the financial services for good. Its a soul sucking industry to work in, and when working with soul sucking people, who are completely two faced, and lazy to do their own job, it makes it so much worse. I want to get into IT, or perhaps even the music industry. Of course I wanna continue with the band, but if I could turn it into a way to make money for a living, then great. But for now, its a side plan.




And speaking of the band, we're still on hiatus while moving happens. I need to speak to James and see how things are going on. I really wanna get back to things. I miss rocking out with loud music. I have been listening to the new Paramore album Riot! recently, and some other rocky stuff, and really want to get some heavy loud sing along songs. And on that side, I've got another song writing book. I lost my last one, which means I lost the songs I wrote. One wasn't great, but I liked the second one, and can't remember enough to rewrite it. So I think I'll try some new ones.
And of course, if my laptop was functioning, I would try to record some music for it too.




Now gonna go get some lunch, eat up some left overs, and then going to see a Mac Genius to get a diagnostic and perhaps pick up a new laptop that I really can't afford.




Go rock things loudly!
