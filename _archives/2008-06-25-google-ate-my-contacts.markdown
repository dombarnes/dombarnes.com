So you may have [heard](http://www.tuaw.com/2008/05/28/10-5-3-sync-your-iphone-contacts-with-google/) a few weeks ago that the Address Book in Leopard now syncs with Gmail contacts. I heard this and thought GREAT! I can keep it all together, up to date with gmail, and have a handy backup.
After firing up Address Book I got it all in sync, and as expected, had a few duplicates which I sorted out.




Unfortunately, as the title suggests, I received a text from my girlfriend but it didn't come up with a name, just her number. So after a visit to the contacts I noticed that ALL her details were gone, except her work email. I had a look at other people and there were more missing people.




So now I have lost faith in the contact syncing. I made no changes at all but somehow lost everyone. I did of course make a backup, but that doesn't seem to import back into Address Book. Thank GOD for my second backup at Mozy.




Right now I'm downloading a backup from a few days ago and will give this stuff another shot. Glad I have my backup in hand in case Google poops on me again.
