I had planned to do this for a while, and the other day I went for it and bought myself a domain.
I haven't had my own site since I 199-something and I built a very web 0.5 site and hosted it on Freeserve's space. Now I have my own dot-com domain and hosting space thanks to GoDaddy. I'm in the process of building the site (still stuck on picking a base wordpress theme) but once thats finished and uploaded, I'll be loading all the content onto it.




I'll be moving all this stuff over there and will cease to update this blog. There is no point running two duplicates after all.




For now, as I said I need to find a good wordpress theme to start with. If you want to help I'd welcome the assistance.
I'm looking for a two column theme, two tone, black background with a light back to the blog content with rounded border edges, a section for a header image, a date button/box on blog post titles, a button style background on those titles, and widget ready.




Not too much is it? I also need a header logo. I am not much of a designer really, and don't have the software for it (should've bought the MacHeist bundle - support isn't an issue as I never ask for it) but since this is often a tech-themed blog something like that, with my name in it or the domain name.
I like Brent's blog over at [iBoughtAMac.com](http://iboughtamac.com) and DaringFireball.net. I like the really simple designs, nothing to busy.




So if you fancy helping out with design, or can point me towards some good themes, then it would be grately apprecaited, of course with adequate publicity. drop me an email. My address is on the right in the About section.




Other than that, look out for the new website launch hopefully not too far away.
