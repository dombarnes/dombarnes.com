On friday I took a trip from Birmingham, to Leicester, and down to Dorking. Firstly, this was not my suggestion. Secondly, I had to get a train to Leicert at 6.37am.  
The whole trip was ruined by the horrible driving of my escort, Matthew. His driving, coupled with a lack of any sort of food that morning, lead to one sick man. I haven't suffered this badly from travel sickness since my boat ride to France in Year 9 and the ferry made me feel aweful. So to suddenly feel like I was gonna pass out our throw up was not good at all.  

The driving I was subject to was a constant change from sudden acceleration, to cruising along, as Matthew put his foot on the pedal to speed up, then took it off to cruise. Unfortunately, this created a very unpleasent rocking motion, not unlike the waves, and I didn't enjoy it. We had to pull over to avoid me chucking up, and I felt a bit peaky all the way down there.  

Luckily the ride back was better, and I felt fine, so the food was a big issue. But next time, I'll take some travel sickness tablets.  

Also, Dorking is a bit dull. Very sleepy.
