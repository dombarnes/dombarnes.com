Here's just one of the 131 photos I took during the first real holiday this year. I had a week off and went up to Fort Augustus with my girlfriend. It was really nice up there in Scotland. Plenty of gorgeous scenery.




We took a trip out on the Loch Ness and even saw Nessie (see Flickr Set)! Took a trip on the Jacobite Railway over the viaduct from the Harry Potter films
