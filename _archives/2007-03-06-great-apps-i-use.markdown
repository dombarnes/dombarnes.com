[digg=http://digg.com/apple/Great_Mac_Apps_Another_list]Thought I would do a list of various apps that I really like and later I will come back and talk a bit more about them.
1.[Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com) -  GTD must have, and all round great app, even as a Spotlight replacement
2. [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/) - Open source Web browser, Cocoa app so bit better than Firefox. I'm using it right now
3. [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com) - because Wordpress doesn't play so well with Safari
4. [VLC](http://www.videolan.org) - best video player I found. Plays practically everything ever made. Ever.
5. [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com) - Good multi-chat program, gTalk, MSN, AOL, Jabber, others. Cute duck icon
6. [Burn](http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/) - Open source CD burning software
7. [AppDelete](http://reggie.ashworth.googlepages.com/appdelete) - Get rid of all those hiding bits of data for applications. Fast
8. [Monolingual](http://monolingual.sourceforge.net/) - Remove unwanted language packs. Free up tons of space (I gained 1.63Gb! Others report up to 4Gb)
9. [Smultron](http://smultron.sourceforge.net/) - good little coding app. Strawberry logo too!
10. [Transmission](http://transmission.m0k.org/) - Torrent app. Handy, easy to use.
11. [Growl](http://growl.info/) - onscreen notifications from many apps (Camino, Transmission, Adium, Skype, iStumbler, Cyberduck
12. [Flip4Mac](http://www.flip4mac.com/) - WMV plugin for Mac. Never touch WMP again!
13. [MenuMeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) - system resource monitoring for the menu bar
14. [Sidetrack](http://tc.versiontracker.com/product/redir/kind/0/db/mac/id/20854/) - Scrolling for older laptops.
15. [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/) - Test out a local version of your website, with mySQL, PHP, and much more
16. [GimmeSomeTune](http://www.eternalstorms.at/) - iTunes plugin. Shows Growl notifications for songs, and gets lyrics
17. [Missing Sync for Windows](http://www.markspace.com/) - sync your Windows Mobile device if you have one (I have a PDA for TomTom)
18. [Democracy](http://www.getdemocracy.com/) - subscribe to RSS feeds, video feeds, torrent feeds, automatically downloads recent
19. [Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/office2004/office2004.aspx?pid=office2004) - because sometimes you need to accommodate Windows users. And Apple has no spreadsheet program. Yet




Wow, that list was longer than I planned. I might have to do a few posts to cover all those off. I'll update this later with links.




_Updated: Thought of another one_
20. [Onxy ](http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs2/english/download.html)- Great app for cleaning cache's, temp files and folders, and keeping things working smoothly
