Its official. Its dead. My G4 Powerbook has bit the bullet, on the way to Davey Jones' locker. A drummer/mac genius confirmed that my hard drive knackered. That combined with the iffy display has lead this machine to the shelf.
Onwards to happier times. A Macbook Pro. Just need to order one. Then wait. Then pray to god I can transfer my files over before it dies.




So I'll be out of contact for a while until the replacement arrives. So no blog, no feeds, no podcasts, limited emails.




Please spare a thought for all those dead and dying laptops that are destined to gather dust and be forgotten for their new replacement.




Powerbook, you served me well.
