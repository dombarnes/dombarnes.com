Just saw this story on Digg. Its about an HP Analyists meeting and the happy occurance of 4 Macbooks/Macbook Pro's.  Apparently these meetings are often plagued with Dells and Thinkpads all politely running Windows. But the 4 Macbooks caused some disturbance. Mark Hurd, CEO, said "That notebook you've got there is a challenge to us" before later sending down an HP exec to drop off some business cards. Its good to see people realising that Mac's are just as capable of running the day-to-day software you need to work and live in most industries, and even better when it ruffles some feathers in the process. All the PC makers need to sit down and think why Apple's computers are so popular on design and work with that, innovate, rather than replicating them with cheaper materials.
Somehow I can't imagine anyone sitting at an Apple meeting with a Dell. Even if they did, I don't expect Steve Jobs would see it as competition, or a "challenge".
