Yesterday, Google announced their Music Beta service at Google I/O, the developer conference for the Goog. Music Beta is a cloud based music service (not that unlike Amazon's Cloud Music service). You run a local client, upload your music library and then you can access your music anywhere.
So whats wrong with that? Well firstly, you can upload up to 20,000 songs. There is no mention of file size, so you could upload 320kbps FLAC files if you want. You can even upload your m4a audio from iTunes, unless its protected m4p files. Once my library is uploaded (taking probably 2 days on a decent broadband connection) I can access my music from up to 8 different Android devices, or a web browser. But not simultaneously. So I had a phone, and a XOOM (hah!) which my fianc√©e borrows, but now I can't listen to my music, because she is listening to it. You have to stop listening on one device to start on another.




When you lose you internet connection, its not a problem. The recently listened items are still available to listen to as they are stored locally, which seems to contradict the claim that it requires no storage space on your device. You can also select albums to store locally on the device for later consumption (similar to Spotify). But to me, recently listened to songs is useless. I don't listen to the same 25 songs over and over. I jump around my library and want to listen to stuff I haven't heard for a while. At least you can copy all your music to your Android device [via USB](http://www.google.com/support/music/bin/answer.py?answer=1250234) (if you have enough internal storage). Thats novel.




The problem of being able to access your music anywhere is difficult, and realistically, it requires a mix of local syncing and streaming. For me, an iTunes solution with local syncing and wireless access to the non-synced content is the goal.




Maybe we'll see that in the [North Carolina Data Centre](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=north+carolina+data+centre#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=%22north+carolina+data+centre%22+apple&aq=f&aqi=g-j1&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&fp=9b75b7254ce3963).
