So I've been using [Wordpress ](http://www.wordpress.com)for longer than I realised. And I'm just not happy with it. The software is great, I just don't like this theme, or any of the other ones available. I'm ok with hosting my own site, (I've got it running on my Powerbok) but I don't know if I really want to pay for hosting and maintain it that way.
I think I'd like to, but there are three things I need to decide first.




1. Who shall I host with. [GoDaddy ](http://www.godaddy.com)is the obvious option. But there are probably plenty of others cheaper.
2. What domain name do I wan't? Its set in stone forever so it has to be good.
3. What [theme](http://themes.wordpress.org) of the many thousands, and plugins, do I use?




I think I could probably run it fine. Just get a copy of [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch) to FTP everything to the server, and keep a local copy just in case. But is it more work that its worth?
