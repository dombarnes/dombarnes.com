The news has come across the wire that Twitter has bought Tweetdeck, the popular desktop tweeting application. This comes after rumours of discussions with both Tweetdeck and Ubermedia.
This adds to Twitters acquisitions, now including Tweetie for Mac and iPhone, both developed by Loren Brichter. What this calls into question however is the place of Tweetdeck as an application.




Twitter already has a great Mac application, Twitter for Mac, available in the Mac App Store. Given that Tweetdeck is an Adobe Air application, it leaves the question of where it stands as a desktop client. If it remains as an active program, then where does it stand with Mac users? How do you tell new users there are two applications, and how do they choose? If its aimed as a Windows only application, it makes for an inconsistent user experience, if they switch between the two OS's.




So will it even stay? Perhaps Twitter bought Tweetdeck to get all its users, and intends to push them to a native Windows client, and ditch the current Tweetdeck application. Or maybe Tweetdeck gets scrapped entirely, and this is purely a purchase of talent and to remove the competition.




Tweetdeck only accounts for about 13% of usage amongst non-official applications (5.46% overall), but is still second place to Ubersocial, and far behind the web interface. So it seems hard to believe that its a $50m purchase for 5.46% of the market. That would give Twitter an estimated value of $915m, which is ridiculous. Or [is it](http://www.numeru.com/index.php/articles/-investment-banking/495-jpmorgan-twitter-deal-is-said-to-value-startup-at-45-billion.html)?
