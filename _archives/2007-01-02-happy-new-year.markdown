It may be a day late but happy new year everyone. Like many people, I hope this one is better than the last (which would probably go for most people unless you had a fantastic year).
I'm not much of a resolution maker. I see how the new year can be seen as a fresh start but why can't every day be like that? Either way, I have not made resolutions this year, merely recorded my hopes on someone's digital camera for prosperity. My hopes for the year are to finish my A+ exam at least, and help (beyond playing bass) record some songs once we've finished them. There is a recording studio at Rich Bitch but it costs more and while I have [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/garageband) and [Logic Express](http://www.apple.com/logicexpress) on my laptop I might try it myself.




On the subject, just two things to mention. My main gift at Christmas was a Boss ODB-3 Bass Overdrive pedal. I have yet to give this a try but hope for good things. I have a Zoom multi-effects pedal but they're not very good and I haven't got time to sit down and figure out how to make my own so I am gonna try the single pedal method. The other gift was a JamPack from Apple which covers the rhythm section so I can hopefully throw some drum beats down on a few acoustic tracks James sent me.




One impending doom which I fear is my laptop. I have a 15" Powerbook G4 which I think is slowly dying. I've had little trouble since owning it, had to reinstall Mac OS X a few times through my own negligence, but now the display is starting to go like many others on the [Apple Discussion Forums](http://discussions.apple.com). I'm going to keep using it and hope it lasts a bit longer but then I will just splash out on a new [Macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook) I think. Hopefully Macworld will bring some nice revisions but I would like a black version.




Anyway, best wishes to you all in the new year. Hope you all have a few moments to look back on by the time its past!
