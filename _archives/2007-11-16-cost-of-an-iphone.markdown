So I've been using my iPhone for about a week now. Its lovely. But this is about the cost.I was watching a video on YouTube about the iPhone making a deal about the overall cost. So I wanted to address the issues raised.
Contract Length - O2 require an 18 month contract. OH MY GOD! 18 Months? Now, I remember a few years back 12 month contracts were the main thing. Now, its extremely unlikely that you'll get a 12 month contract. Go into any shop, or onto any website and the default option now is 18 months. So thats not a big deal. Get over it. (and Orange offer 24 months too)




Contract cost - 35 massive pounds per month. WOAH! Thats loads(!). Now I realise that that may be a lot for some people, but lets look at the other networks. Orange  offer 7 contracts under £35 per month, 2 at £35 per month, and 4 over £35. In equivalent tariff would set you back at least £30 a month for the same or more texts and calls.




Data Package - On top of the basic cost you would have to pay data charges. For 200MB of data (the former limit on O2) you would pay an additonal £35! It costs £8 for 3oMB of data. So take into account that O2 is Unlimited and thats an infinite cost (only limited by your use)!




Wifi - The Cloud.net offers unlimited WiFi use for £7.99 per month. Its free for iPhone users




Handset Cost - OK you can get a free handset from most carriers, like the N95 (the most compared handset). Great. It plays music, videos, has GPS, 3G etc. I could get into that discussion but I won't. iPhone costs you £269. Thats it. Its yours. If you cancel the contract, its yours. If you cancel any other one, you have to pay the rest of the contract. If you cancel within the 14 days you have to return your handset. Not with the iPhone. What about the features.Total




Costs




Non-iPhone handset		Free
Contract				   £30.00 x 18 months
Data Use				   £35.00 x 18 months
Wifi						£7.99 x 18 months
Total = 				     £1313.82




iPhone					£269
Contract				£35.00
Data use				Included
Wifi                                        Included
Total                                                 £899




Now excuse my maths, but it would appear that a non-iPhone costs £414 LESS than a comparable option. lets also consider you want a full internet browser, photo browser, music player. You didn't pay for your phone so you could buy an iPod Touch. Thats another £199 for 8GB. So the total is now £1512.




So there you go. Its not a bad deal. Its a GREAT deal, and you have a fantastic handset with a full internet browser, large screen for viewing photos, videos, maps, stocks, weather, calendar, and more. You get Visual Voicemail. No other network offers this. Random access voicemail is probably a key feature for people who get lots of messages, like sales people. A full web browser with an intuitive interface is fantastic. For that mobile, you might look at a Nokia N800 (£229).




Please, argue these points. Let me know your thoughts. Have I done the maths wrong? Am I overlooking something?
