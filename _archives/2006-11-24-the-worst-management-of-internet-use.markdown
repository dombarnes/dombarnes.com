So I started my current job in July 2006, and like all companies, was given email and internet access. All I had to do was read the usual policies about improper use, business related sites only, nothing rude, etc etc. Then about 7 weeks after I started, I was called into my bosses office. He asked me if I knew about the company policy on internet use. Now I had used it a fair bit, but I didn't visit any sites deemed "inappropriate". Anyway, I said yeah I'd read the policies and he asked if I was told about charging limits. I said no. He then proceeded to tell me that I had managed to build up a bill of £75 on internet usage!
Needless to say I was shocked. Now even when I had dialup and was charged the local rate of 1p per minute, I didn't rack up that much. He then explained to me that all staff are allocated £5 of usage per month (he didn't explain how that is measured) And it is charged, not through bandwidth usage, but time! So every minute I spent, with a browser open, watching the Digg homepage, refreshing every so often, was costing more and more. He realised this was probably the case and advised me for the future. So I left feeling embarrassed, and confused on the charging structure.




Anyway, a few months have passed, and I've had no more conversations. I still use the web a fair bit, but close windows whenever possible.




Worse still, they don't even have WiFi, and only just moved up to XP. Now I'm a mac geek. I love my powerbook, and don't envision it breaking any time soon, and when it does, I'll get a Macbook or Macbook Pro. I don't really like working in Windows but I have to at work. I have done all I can to make my XP desktop look like Mac OS X, and its working well. I long for a job when I can work off a laptop of my choice. If I have to, I'll run Windows on a Macbook (dual boot though, not Virtual Machine) but I guess to get there, I need to keep studying for my A+, N+, MCSA and Cisco certificates. Sigh
