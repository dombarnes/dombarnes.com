I got news today that our cat of over 19 years, Twinkle, was put to sleep the other night.
She had been getting worse recently over the past few weeks, and this weekend she got a lot worse quickly, and after a word with the vet, it was discovered she had either a kidney problem or an over-active thyroid.




In her honour, I made this video, and by made I mean put music to this video.
