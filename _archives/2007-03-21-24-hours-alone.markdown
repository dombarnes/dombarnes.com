So I saw this [story on Diggnation](http://www.shutdownday.org/) the other week and am writing to support the campaign.
So, on 24 March (Saturday to make it a bit easier), its Shutdown Day. Turn off your computer, step away from the keyboard, put down that mouse, and take your eyes off the screen.




This campaign has two main objectives.
1. Save massive amounts of electricity by having so many PC's turned off. It all goes to help global warming (and you can't deny its happening. There's snow and sunshine in the middle of March)
2. Get some rest! Go outside, enjoy the sun/snow/rain/other weather, see some friends, or family, do those DIY things you've been putting off, get some GTD'ing going, tidy things, or just spend time with the kids. The main thing is to spend your day without your computer, PDA, laptop, or other devices. Hell, even go somewhere without the GPS. Try an A to Z.




I'll be doing this, and I encourage you to as well.  Add your name to the list, support this cause, and encourage your friends to as well.
