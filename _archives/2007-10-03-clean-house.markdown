Well tonight I've spent a few hours trying to make things a bit neater at home.We've been in this house for about a month now and its getting closer and closer to being straight. We still need a bed frame, and to get rid of some large boxes (waiting to offload them to someone at work actually).
Today I've sorted the under stairs cupboard, discovered the shoe rack we have won't fit, and thrown various things away. Now I'm stuck on CD spindle cases. Do I throw them out or hold into them incase I come up with some ingenious use? Probably throw but not just yet.
Well thats about all for tonight really. Its too late to carry on much more. Sleep is calling me
