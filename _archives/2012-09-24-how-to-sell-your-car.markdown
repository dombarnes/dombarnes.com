Last month, I made the choice to sell my car. I had a number of reasons. Partly due to the cost of running a 2.0L car (even if it was 14 years old), and partly because my use of it was going to reduce after my surgery. Having never had to sell a car before (getting rid of a written off car doesn't count) I thought I would try a few methods.

I started with [GumTree](http://gumtree.co.uk) and placed an ad (for free) with some photos and a description of the car asking for £1200. Gumtree just shows ads in date order, so if your ad isn't the most recent, it will get pushed down the list. I had it up for about 10 days with no interest, so decided to reduce the price to £1100, as well as bump it back to the top of the listings (for a small fee). Again I had no interest from Gumtree.

After that, I tried two methods. I listed it on Craigslist (which doesn't get used much in the UK) and on AutoTrader. Auto Trader will let you list your car for 14 days for £9.99 provided the cost of the car is under £1000. So I thought I would reduce the price further to £999 and list it there. 13 days went past with no real interest from either places. I had one man call and offer £700 for it (said that was the price of similar cars on AutoTrader - it wasn't) and two scam emails via Craigslist, one of which is below:

Finally, on the last day of the advert, I had some calls. One person wanted to come and look at it immediately, and the other wanted to find someone to go with her to look and check the car over. The first person came, took a look - he worked for KwikFit so had a good idea of what to ask and look for, unlike me - and took a test drive. He was interested but wanted to look at insurance costs, and some other stuff. The next day, he came back, took one last look and bought it.

If AutoTrader hadn't worked, I was going to try eBay Classifieds (a friend had good responses from them before) or PartEx, as I do think I'll get another car. But knowing what sort of deals they do, I wouldn't have got more than about £600 for it. If I was going to sell a decent car, I would probably use AutoTrader again.

So how much did I lose on the whole experience? For a car I owned for only 5 months, I sold it for just over half what I paid for it. Minus the cost of insurance, the breakdown cost from the broken filler pipe, and fuel costs, it wasn't a great move.
