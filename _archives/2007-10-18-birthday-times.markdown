I didn't really mention this but it was my birthday a few weeks ago. I turned the big old age of 24. Nothing special right? So I decided to treat this birthday as a quiet one. I went to Norwich to see my folks, my sister and my cute nephew, and of course get presents. On the day, I met Katie for lunch, and then went out for dinner in the evening. It was a nice quiet affair. I had some presents and cards to open and look at (and many thanks to everyone for those).But I got some grief at work. I'd mentioned occasionally at work when the day was, but didn't say anything on the day because I didn't wanna make a big deal. And then a week ago, someone asked me if it was that day, to which I said yes, and so people started to make a issue out of the fact that I didn't say anything!




Why is it such a thing that you don't wanna do anything about your birthday? Of course, working in an office, its customary to buy food (why am I spending money on my own birthday?) for the office, so some people implied that I was just trying to get out of that. Bollocks.
So all in all, the day swept by quietly. I had some nice stuff (cool socks, vouchers, cows, and a tricky puzzle block game. Thanks Sis), and the main spend was my laptop.
But its all over now. Another 350 odd days till the next. Woo-frigging-hoo(!)
