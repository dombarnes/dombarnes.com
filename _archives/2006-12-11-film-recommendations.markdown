Been to see two films this week. [Stranger Than Fiction ](http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/strangerthanfiction/)and [The Holiday](http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/theholiday/). I would recommend them both.




Its been ages since I went to the cinema (and I need to go lots since I have a unlimited entry card) and I was really pleased with these two. Stranger Than Fiction is a great story of Harold (Will Ferrell) who suddenly hears someone narrating his life, and mentions he will inevitably die.  

The Holiday is a nice story about 4 people, cominig together, falling into and out of love with others. I thought Jack Black was really good in this. He wasn't crazy, he was a charismatic guy who I'd like to meet.




If you wanna see two feel good films, go see these. Soundtracks on both were great too. I think the music can make the film.
