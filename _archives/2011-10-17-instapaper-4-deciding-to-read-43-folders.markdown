[Marco](http://marco.org) releases the latest update to Instapaper, a fantastic reading application. I haven't got an iPad, but I borrowed one for a few months and Instapaper was my goto place to read when I had some downtime. If I still had it, I would be even more excited for this update.
As usual, Merlin Mann offers his unique view on the update, and how its helped him read more, rather that flinging something [red at something green](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds)




Spend the $4.99 and get this. Then add the [bookmarklet](http://www.instapaper.com/extras) to your Safari Bookmark Bar as Command + 1.
