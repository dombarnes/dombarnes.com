I've been looking around for jobs recently and made the decision I need to improve my appeal to employers.I currently have the CompTIA A+ and N+ qualifications, which don't seem to count for much around these parts. So, the next best step, seems to be to aim for the Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA). For me, its only 3 exams to take, 2 server and 1 client, and I think it'd make sense for that to be Windows 7.




I'm hoping that after that, or perhaps even during, I might get the opportunity to study for the Apple exams, aiming to become a Certified Professional at some point.




Hopefully I can be less slack about studying this time around, since it took me over a year to do my A+ and about a year to do my Network+. Suggestions welcome!
