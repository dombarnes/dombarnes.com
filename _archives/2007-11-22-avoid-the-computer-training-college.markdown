Last year I signed up for courses with the Computer Training College (www.ctcollege.co.uk).
I signed up for the CompTIA A+, N+, Microsoft MCSA and Cisco CCNA. I have reached the stage where I am ready to take my A+ exams and contacted them about booking them. I was then told that the exam fees were not included in the course fees I had paid up front.




Having now done some research online I have found out that the CT College have often been quoted as fleecing students. They charge large fees, provide little support, and misrepresent their services.I am currently speaking to them and will try to cancel my course, and reclaim my course fees. I will be looking to start court action and contact the Trading Standards if I do not get a reasonable response from them.




I'll keep you updated with my progress, but I would warn anyone considering study with them to reconsider QUICKLY. Having done the study for one qualification, I could do just as good a job with a Â£30 book from Borders or Amazon.

**Update 1**: I received a letter today stating that they stand by their original letter. They have no record of my phone call to them querying the exam fees being included, and believe that it was clearly explained that they were external and excluded. Luckily my girlfriend was in the room with me at the time and can vouch for this. My next action is to get copies of my phone bill showing this phone call to them, and ask them to investigate that. If they cannot prove that they told me otherwise, I will argue some more. As I said, I also have corroboration of this matter.




**Update 2:** I've written back to them for a third time, enclosing proof of a phone call they claim they have no record of where I was told that my exams were included. I now wait for a reply.




**Update 3: **I have set up a [Google Group here](http://groups.google.com/group/ct-college-complaints?) where people can share their thoughts a bit better, and hopefully get the word out about these people.
