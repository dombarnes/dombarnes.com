I may have mentioned [iBoughtAMac.com](http://iboughtamac.com) - Its a website run by [Brent](http://twitter.com/iboughtamac). Well he had a daughter recently, [Cadie Spore](http://cadiespore.com) (lovely name) and it looks like she's going to be a geek baby. Why is this important? Well because you can get some fantastic onesie's from his shop at [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com/iboughtamac). If I had a kid, or was going to, I would be buying about 10 of these. They are great. I love the [TCP/IP](http://www.cafepress.com/iboughtamac.218178322), [Beta](http://www.cafepress.com/iboughtamac.218175119), and [I'm Cute](http://www.cafepress.com/iboughtamac.218178320).So if you're having a kid, like [Merlin](http://flickr.com/photos/merlin/sets/72157602806576128/) [Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com), and [Alex Lindsay](http://alexlindsay.vox.com/) did recently, then head on over and buy a few of these. I know I will be when that time comes. [iBoughtAMac at CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com/iboughtamac)
