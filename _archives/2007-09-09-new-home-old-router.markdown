So I've moved house. Last weekend was the big day and we got a whole house moved in one day, that included picking up keys and going to Ikea.
Now the biggest problem is connectivity. And it explains why I'm in Starbucks doing this. We got out BT line connected last tuesday. Then I called Virgin to get Broadband ordered. And then it stopped, cos they didn't have our new number on they're system. So I called back the next day, and tried again, with no luck. So I tried a third time on Friday and had success. So our broadband will be active next thursday. THURSDAY! Thats a year away when there is an Apple Event between (New ipods, lots of them, and a cheaper iPhone YAY!).




But the real problem is the router. I had to switch back off my Linksys WRT54G using DD-WRT to my old Netgear DG834G as its phoneline broadband, not cable/dsl. And the problem is my Macbook Pro seems to struggle staying on or even finding the wireless network. And I don't know why. Its plain as day there. Only one other Wifi box nearby, which is on channel 11 and I'm on 1 or 2. But I can't get it to connect.




I can't figure out why. It doesn't matter too much now since there is no interweb connection but when that bad boy starts, I will wanna use it.
So if anyone else has an idea, or a similar problem with their DG834G, let me know. Where is my SSID!!!!




Â **Update: **Turns out the problem seems to be with the channel my DG834G was broadcasting on. I had it running on 1, which didn't work well. After some browsing the Console and trying it out again, I noticed the problem. I've switched up to 6 and it works perfectly now.
