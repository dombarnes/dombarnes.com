So I've booked off the 9th November to go get my iPhone. Rumour has it that it will be available at 6pm, like the US release. And what I'm wondering is what to do during the day. I'll have my laptop there (and power cable, very important) and I was wondering about live blogging my day waiting there.I have thought about simply blogging during the day, while uploading photos to Flickr. I've also thought about something like Viddler or uStream.tv and just broadcasting some of my day there. Or is there another service I could use to report on my day in the Bullring.
Well I'd love to hear some ideas, so please, drop your thoughts in the comments.
