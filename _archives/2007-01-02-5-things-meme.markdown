I saw this over at the [Evil Genius Chronicles](http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org) and while I haven't been tagged by anyone, I thought I would start off. So here are 5 little known facts about me.
1. I actually have an Economics A-level, even if it is an E
2. I once went for job as a Trainee Quantity Surveyor. I had little interest in the job really but got offered it.
3. As a child, I always seemeed to win a bottle of wine on raffles and tombola's, but I'm not a big wine drinker now
4. My first claim to fame was being on The Time The Place (local discussion show like Kilroy) with my mum when I was about 6.
5. When I lived in the first house I can remember, I used to watch the bin men on thursdays collect our rubbish and I wanted to be one when I was older.




There you go. Not that interesting but facts none the less.
