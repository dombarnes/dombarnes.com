So I am home, I've got my iPhone and its all working.Setup was  simple. Plug in, go through the iTunes registration, select price plan, give your iTunes Account ID, and give any number transfer details. Once that was done, you wait for activation, and for me this took less than a minute.Once thats done, you can go ahead and sync. Like everything else, choose your playlists, your bookmarks, email accounts etc, to sync. and thats it. iPhone sorted.So far I'm just trying to reduce my music so I can get some videos on it. Apart from that its great.I'll be giving it a true test run this weekend so a more detailed report soon.
