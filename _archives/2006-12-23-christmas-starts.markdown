After a long drive (including a slow move around Market Harborough) I'm finally back at my parents house. It wasn't a great drive. I was stuck between feeling warm and slightly sleepy and having the window open and it being breezy which kept me awake.
Anyway, I'm here and my role as tech support has begun. My mum has been given a very old Sony Vaio which had been forgotten about. She wanted to do a Powerpoint presentation on a budget at this meeting and was given this and a Epson projector to use. I started it up and after battling with the awkward WiFi finally got it online. So I went to update it first and got told to check the time. So I did and it thought it was 15 October 2006 and 10.10am. Blimey. It really hadn't been used in a while. So I updated that, then syncd it to the NTS. Finally good to roll. First up got 62 updates. then XPSP2 update. which is now running. In the mean time I got the projector working and showed my mum how to get it working. But since this laptop doesn't have powerpoint she can't edit her presentations. So she might just use the other one.




Anyway this laptop is a monster. The power brick is twice the size of the one for my Powerbook, its really thick and heafty. I would hate to carry it around.




Anyway, the Christmas tree is loaded with presents, the freezer is full and Christmas starts monday. So fingers crossed tomorrow will go ok. I'm planning on doing some study for my A+ but that might not happen so much. Good intensions and all that.




Happy Holidays everyone!
