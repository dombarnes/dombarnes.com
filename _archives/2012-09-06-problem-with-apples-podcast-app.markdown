Apple released their standalone Podcast app a few months back. It's a beautiful app as many have said, and yes it suffered teething problems at first. But what are its other issues?
1. There is no manual refresh option.
2. There is no way to set the order of the unplayed podcasts list. It's in date order, newest first. Who listens to podcasts in reverse chronological order?
3. You can't access the unplayed podcasts list in tile view.
4. Getting podcasts to play in oldest first order is difficult. If you are subscribed to a show, you see all played or unplayed episodes. So to reach the latest, you must scroll scroll scroll to the bottom.
5. It occasionally marks old shows as Unplayed again.
6. There is no iCloud sync between iPhone and iPad apps. So I keep having to mark old shows as watched.
7. The Podcast show list is in date added of the show. Or you can manually sort them. That may work fine for 5 podcasts, but when you have 17 subscriptions, you just want name order or show with the newest episode.




If they fixed these issues (mainly 4,5 and 6) I would probably use it full time but as of today, it just doesn't cut it. I'm sticking with InstaCast.
